<title>为什么写这本书？</title>

<para>在聚会上, 当我告诉别人我写自由软件时，人们不再是一幅茫然的表情。他们会说，“哦，开源软件──就像linux？”
 我使劲地点头：“对！我就是做那个的。”不再被凉在一边的感觉真好。要在过去，下面的一个
问题通常会是这个：“你怎么靠那个挣钱？” 为了回答他们，我必须概述开源软件的概念：有一些
组织致力于维持某些软件的生存，他们不卖拷贝，而是确保这些软件能够免费获得并且有人维护，能
够作为工具而不是商品使用。</para>

<para>然而之后的问题不再总是同钱有关。开源软件<footnote><para>The
terms "open source" and "free" are essentially synonymous in this
context; they are discussed more in
<xref linkend="free-vs-open-source"/><phrase output="printed"> in
<xref linkend="introduction"/></phrase>.</para></footnote>的商业案例不再是如此
神秘，许多的非编程人士已经了解到──或至少不再惊奇──全职做开源的人也不是没有。于是，我越来越频繁
地被问到的第二个问题是：“那么，开源软件是怎么运作的？”</para>

<para>我手头没有现成的满意答案，更困难之处在于当我试图给出一个时，我意识到它是一个多么复杂的主题。
  运行一个自由软件计划完全不同于商业运作（想像一下必须时常同大部分你从未谋面的志愿者们商讨产品的性能
  的情景！）。由于某些原因，也和传统的非盈利机构不同，  也不同于一个政府。它和所有事物都有相似之处，但我
  谨慎地下了一个结论，自由软件是 <foreignphrase>sui generis</foreignphrase>（Sui generis是一个古拉丁语词汇，意指属于自己的类型和独一无二的特点。这个学院派哲学的产物表示一种理念，意指一种
  无法被其他概念容纳的实物或是事实）。 它可以和很多事情进行比较，但是没有一个能划等号。 一个自由软件计划
  能被<emphasis>创造出</emphasis>，并且会受到对此感兴趣的社团的强烈影响。但它不属于任何一个个人或
团体，会源源不断从某些地方冒出对此感兴趣的人，所以它不会被任何单方面地终止。每个人都有无限的权利，每
个人又都没有权利。它形成了这样一种有趣的动态平衡。 </para>

<para>这就是为何我要写此书的原因。 自由软件运动已经进化出了一种独特的文化，一种信奉个人有能让软件做任何
事情的自由为中心信条的思想。这种自由的结果并不是每个人对代码的各自行事，相反是热心的合作。实际上，能在合
作中胜任是自由软件运动中最有价值的技巧之一。管理这样的计划就是处理一堆庞大的合作关系，在这里个人的能力不仅
和他人一起工作，而且通过一条崭新的合作方式能对软件做出实际的贡献。 这本书试图描述实行这种方式所需要的技术。
它不会包含全部，但是重要的起步。 </para>

<para>优秀的自由软件是其自身计划的有价值产物，我希望能让那些在本书中寻找如何达到这点的方法的读者满意。 但除此之外，
我想传达的是同充满活力的开源软件开发团队合作，用开源软件提供方式的直接同用户互动都是令人绝对愉悦的体验。   成为
一个成功的自由软件计划的一分子是 <emphasis>有趣的</emphasis>， 这才是驱动整个系统运转的终极动力。</para>

<title>谁该读此书？</title>

<para>这本书是面向那些着手开始一个开源软件计划或已经开始但想知道现在该做什么的软件开发人员和经理们的。 对那些打算加
入一个开源软件计划但是又没有经验的人此书也是有所裨益的。  </para>

<para>读者不必是程序员，但应该知道软件工程的一些基本概念，比如源代码，编译器和补丁。 </para>

<para>无论是作为用户还是开发者，都不必具备开源软件的经验。那些之前在自由软件计划中工作过的人也许会发现这本书中的某些
部分太浅显了，想跳过这些部分。因为知道 潜在的读者中可能很多人已经有了广泛的经验。所以我努力清楚地标明章节，当某些内容是可
以被对材料熟悉的读者跳过的，也会有说明。 </para>

<sect1 id="sources">
<title>资料</title>

<para>此书中的很多原始材料都是从Subversion计划(<ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org/"/>)的五年工作中来的。
Subversion是一个从零开始的开源版本控制系统，目的在于替代 CVS成为开源社区版本控制系统实际上的（译者注，这里作者用了拉丁
语de facto）选择。这个计由我的雇主，  CollabNet公司
(<ulink url="http://www.collab.net/"/>)在2000年初发起，感谢上帝CollaNet从一开始就正确理解如何将它作为运作一个完
全的合作性，分部性项目运作。 从一开始我们就吸收了很多的志愿者。现在这个计划有50多名开发者，其中只有少数是CollaNet的雇员。 </para>

<para>在很多方面Subversion都是开源软件计划的一个典型例子。最终我在上面花费的时间超出另外我最初的预想。部分是因为它方面：
无论何时我需要一个现像的样本，我的脑海里便会立即浮现出Subversion中的一个实例。但另外的因素是可操作性。虽然我不同程度地参
与了其他几个开源项目，并且会和很多的朋友和相关的人交谈。我很快就发现，当写成文字时，所有的断言都需要经过事实的检验。我不想仅
仅根据我所能在它们的公开邮件列表上列出的文档而对事件发表意见。如果有人想用以上的方式尝试Subversion，我知道，她大约只有50%
 的正确率， 而另外50%是错误的。因此，当需要从一个我没有直接参与的项目找寻灵感或者实例时，我会找一个信得过并且了解内情的，让他
 来 解释项目的真实情况。</para>

<para> 虽然过去五年我一直在做Subversion， 但我从事自由软件行业已有12个年头了。因而，其它一些项目也对本书有所影响：</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>自由软件基金会(Free Software Foundation)的GNU Emacs 文本编辑器项目。我在其中维护了几个小的软件包</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>Concurrent Versions System (CVS) 版本控制系统是我在1994-1995期间与Jim Blandy全力投入的一个项目，
  此后，我只是断断续续地参与这个项目的工作。</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>Apache 软件基金会（Apache Software Foundation）的开源软件项目集， 尤其是Apache可移植运行库
  （Apache Portable Runtime (APR)和Apache HTTP服务器。</para> 
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>OpenOffice.org, the Berkeley Database from
            Sleepycat, and MySQL Database; I have not been
            involved with these projects personally, but have observed
            them and, in some cases, talked to people there.</para>

  <listitem><para>GNU Debugger (GDB) 项目（同上）。</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>Debian项目 （同上）。</para>

<para>当然，以上这个名单并不完整。正如多数的自由软件编程员一样，我不定期地追踪自由软件行业中许多不同的项目， 以对行业的整体情况有
全面的了解。在此，我不一一列举所有的项目，但在书中会适时提及。</para>

<sect1 id="acknowledgments">
<title>Acknowledgments</title>

<para>This book took four times longer to write than I thought it
would, and for much of that time felt rather like a grand piano
suspended above my head wherever I went.  Without help from many
people, I would not have been able to complete it while staying
sane.</para>

<para>Andy Oram, my editor at O'Reilly, was a writer's dream.  Aside
from knowing the field intimately (he suggested many of the topics),
he has the rare gift of knowing what one meant to say and helping one
find the right way to say it.  It has been an honor to work with him.
Thanks also to Chuck Toporek for steering this proposal to Andy right
away.</para>

<para>Brian Fitzpatrick reviewed almost all of the material as I wrote
it, which not only made the book better, but kept me writing when I
wanted to be anywhere in the world but in front of the computer.  Ben
Collins-Sussman and Mike Pilato also checked up on progress, and were
always happy to discuss&mdash;sometimes at length&mdash;whatever topic
I was trying to cover that week.  They also noticed when I slowed
down, and gently nagged when necessary.  Thanks, guys.</para>

<para>Biella Coleman was writing her dissertation at the same time
I was writing this book.  She knows what it means to sit down and
write every day, and provided an inspiring example as well as a
sympathetic ear.  She also has a fascinating anthropologist's-eye view
of the free software movement, giving both ideas and references that I
was able use in the book.  Alex Golub&mdash;another anthropologist
with one foot in the free software world, and also finishing his
dissertation at the same time&mdash;was exceptionally supportive early
on, which helped a great deal.</para>

<para>Micah Anderson somehow never seemed too oppressed by his own
writing gig, which was inspiring in a sick, envy-generating sort of
way, but he was ever ready with friendship, conversation, and (on at
least one occasion) technical support.  Thanks, Micah!</para>

<para>Jon Trowbridge and Sander Striker gave both encouragement and
concrete help&mdash;their broad experience in free software provided
material I couldn't have gotten any other way.</para>

<para>Thanks to Greg Stein not only for friendship and well-timed
encouragement, but for showing the Subversion project how important
regular code review is in building a programming community.  Thanks
also to Brian Behlendorf, who tactfully drummed into our heads the
importance of having discussions publicly; I hope that principle is
reflected throughout this book.</para>

<para>Thanks to Benjamin "Mako" Hill and Seth Schoen, for various
conversations about free software and its politics; to Zack Urlocker
and Louis Suarez-Potts for taking time out of their busy schedules to
be interviewed; to Shane on the Slashcode list for allowing his post
to be quoted; and to Haggen So for his enormously helpful comparison
of canned hosting sites.</para>

<para>Thanks to Alla Dekhtyar, Polina, and Sonya for their unflagging
and patient encouragement.  I'm very glad that I will no longer have
to end (or rather, try unsuccessfully to end) our evenings early to go
home and work on "The Book."</para>

<para>Thanks to Jack Repenning for friendship, conversation, and a
stubborn refusal to ever accept an easy wrong analysis when a harder
right one is available.  I hope that some of his long experience with
both software development and the software industry rubbed off on this
book.</para>

<para>CollabNet was exceptionally generous in allowing me a flexible
schedule to write, and didn't complain when it went on far longer than
originally planned.  I don't know all the intricacies of how
management arrives at such decisions, but I suspect Sandhya Klute, and
later Mahesh Murthy, had something to do with it&mdash;my thanks to
them both.</para>

<para>The entire Subversion development team has been an inspiration
for the past five years, and much of what is in this book I learned
from working with them.  I won't thank them all by name here, because
there are too many, but I implore any reader who runs into a
Subversion committer to immediately buy that committer the drink of
his choice&mdash;I certainly plan to.</para>

<para>Many times I ranted to Rachel Scollon about the state of the
book; she was always willing to listen, and somehow managed to make
the problems seem smaller than before we talked.  That helped a
lot&mdash;thanks.</para>

<para>Thanks (again) to Noel Taylor, who must surely have wondered why
I wanted to write another book given how much I complained the last
time, but whose friendship and leadership of Golos&aacute; helped keep
music and good fellowship in my life even in the busiest times.
Thanks also to Matthew Dean and Dorothea Samtleben, friends and
long-suffering musical partners, who were very understanding as my
excuses for not practicing piled up.  Megan Jennings was constantly
supportive, and genuinely interested in the topic even though it was
unfamiliar to her&mdash;a great tonic for an insecure writer.  Thanks,
pal!</para>

<para>I had four knowledgeable and diligent reviewers for this book:
Yoav Shapira, Andrew Stellman, Davanum Srinivas, and Ben Hyde.  If I
had been able to incorporate all of their excellent suggestions, this
would be a better book.  As it was, time constraints forced me to pick
and choose, but the improvements were still significant.  Any errors
that remain are entirely my own.</para>

<para>My parents, Frances and Henry, were wonderfully supportive as
always, and as this book is less technical than the previous one, I
hope they'll find it somewhat more readable.</para>

<para>Finally, I would like to thank the dedicatees, Karen Underhill
and Jim Blandy.  Karen's friendship and understanding have meant
everything to me, not only during the writing of this book but for the
last seven years.  I simply would not have finished without her help.
Likewise for Jim, a true friend and a hacker's hacker, who first
taught me about free software, much as a bird might teach an airplane
about flying.</para>
