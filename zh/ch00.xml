<title>为什么写这本书？</title>

<para>在聚会上, 当我告诉别人我写自由软件时，人们不再是一幅茫然的表情。他们会说，“哦，开源软件──就像linux？”
 我使劲地点头：“对！我就是做那个的。”不再被凉在一边的感觉真好。要在过去，下面的一个
问题通常会是这个：“你怎么靠那个挣钱？” 为了回答他们，我必须概述开源软件的概念：有一些
组织致力于维持某些软件的生存，他们不卖拷贝，而是确保这些软件能够免费获得并且有人维护，能
够作为工具而不是商品使用。</para>

<para>然而之后的问题不再总是同钱有关。开源软件<footnote><para>The
terms "open source" and "free" are essentially synonymous in this
context; they are discussed more in
<xref linkend="free-vs-open-source"/><phrase output="printed"> in
<xref linkend="introduction"/></phrase>.</para></footnote>的商业案例不再是如此
神秘，许多的非编程人士已经了解到──或至少不再惊奇──全职做开源的人也不是没有。于是，我越来越频繁
地被问到的第二个问题是：“那么，开源软件是怎么运作的？”</para>

<para>我手头没有现成的满意答案，更困难之处在于当我试图给出一个时，我意识到它是一个多么复杂的主题。
  运行一个自由软件计划完全不同于商业运作（想像一下必须时常同大部分你从未谋面的志愿者们商讨产品的性能
  的情景！）。由于某些原因，也和传统的非盈利机构不同，  也不同于一个政府。它和所有事物都有相似之处，但我谨慎地下了一个结论，自由软件是 <foreignphrase>sui generis</foreignphrase>（Sui generi
  s是一个古拉丁语词汇，意指属于自己的类型和独一无二的特点。这个学院派哲学的产物表示一种理念，意指一种
  无法被其他概念容纳的实物或是事实）。 它可以和很多事情进行比较，但是没有一个能划等号。 一个自由软件计划
  能被<emphasis>创造出</emphasis>，并且会受到对此感兴趣的社团的强烈影响。但它不属于任何一个个人或
团体，从某些地方冒出的对此感兴趣的人会持续的存在，所以它不会被任何单方面地终止。每个人都有无限的权利，每
个人都没有权利。它形成了这样一种有趣的动态平衡。 </para>

<para>这就是为何我要写此书的原因。 自由软件运动已经进化出了一种独特的文化，一种信奉个人有能让软件做任何
事情的自由为中心信条的思想。这种自由的结果并不是每个人对代码的各自行事，相反是热心的合作。实际上，在合
作中的胜任是自由软件运动中最优价值的技巧之一。管理这样的计划就是处理一堆庞大的合作关系，在这里个人的能力不仅
和他人一起工作，而且通过一条崭新的合作方式能对软件做出实际的贡献。 这本书试图描述实行这种方式所需要的技术。
它不会包含全部，但是最要的起步。 </para>

<para>优秀的自由软件是其自身计划的有价值产物，我希望能让那些在本书中寻找如何达到这点的方法的读者满意。 但除此之外，
我想传达的是同充满活力的开源软件开发团队合作，用开源软件提供方式的直接同用户互动都是令人绝对愉悦的体验。   成为
一个成功的自由软件计划的一分子是 <emphasis>有趣的</emphasis>， 这才是驱动整个系统运转的终极动力。</para>

<title>Who Should Read This Book?</title>

<para>This book is meant for software developers and managers who are
considering starting an open source project, or who have started one
and are wondering what to do now.  It should also be helpful for
people who just want to participate in an open source project but have
never done so before.</para>

<para>The reader need not be a programmer, but should know basic
software engineering concepts such as source code, compilers, and
patches.</para>

<para>Prior experience with open source software, as either a user or
a developer, is not necessary.  Those who have worked in free software
projects before will probably find at least some parts of the book a
bit obvious, and may want to skip those sections.  Because there's
such a potentially wide range of audience experience, I've made an
effort to label sections clearly, and to say when something can be
skipped by those already familiar with the material.</para>

</sect1>

<!-- ======================== SECTION ============================== -->
<sect1 id="sources">
<title>Sources</title>

<para>Much of the raw material for this book came from five years of
working with the Subversion project
(<ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org/"/>).  Subversion is an open
source version control system, written from scratch, and intended to
replace CVS as the <foreignphrase>de facto</foreignphrase> version
control system of choice in the open source community.  The project
was started by my employer, CollabNet
(<ulink url="http://www.collab.net/"/>), in early 2000, and thank
goodness CollabNet understood right from the start how to run it as a
truly collaborative, distributed effort.  We got a lot of volunteer
developer buy-in early on; today there are 50-some developers on
the project, of whom only a few are CollabNet employees.</para>

<para>Subversion is in many ways a classic example of an open source
project, and I ended up drawing on it more heavily than I originally
expected.  This was partly a matter of convenience: whenever I needed
an example of a particular phenomenon, I could usually call one up
from Subversion right off the top of my head.  But it was also a
matter of verification.  Although I am involved in other free software
projects to varying degrees, and talk to friends and acquaintances
involved in many more, one quickly realizes when writing for print
that all assertions need to be fact-checked.  I didn't want to make
statements about events in other projects based only on what I could
read in their public mailing list archives.  If someone were to try
that with Subversion, I knew, she'd be right about half the time and
wrong the other half.  So when drawing inspiration or examples from a
project with which I didn't have direct experience, I tried to first
talk to an informant there, someone I could trust to explain what was
really going on.</para>

<para>Subversion has been my job for the last 5 years, but I've been
involved in free software for 12.  Other projects that influenced this
book include:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>The GNU Emacs text editor project at the Free
            Software Foundation, in which I maintain a few small
            packages.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>Concurrent Versions System (CVS), which I worked on
            intensely in 1994&ndash;1995 with Jim Blandy, but have been
            involved with only intermittently since.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>The collection of open source projects known as the
            Apache Software Foundation, especially the Apache Portable
            Runtime (APR) and Apache HTTP Server.</para> 
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>OpenOffice.org, the Berkeley Database from
            Sleepycat, and MySQL Database; I have not been
            involved with these projects personally, but have observed
            them and, in some cases, talked to people there.</para> 
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>GNU Debugger (GDB) (likewise).</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>The Debian Project (likewise).</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>This is not a complete list, of course.  Like most open source
programmers, I keep loose tabs on many different projects, just to
have a sense of the general state of things.  I won't name all of them
here, but they are mentioned in the text where appropriate.</para>

<sect1 id="acknowledgments">
<title>Acknowledgments</title>

<para>This book took four times longer to write than I thought it
would, and for much of that time felt rather like a grand piano
suspended above my head wherever I went.  Without help from many
people, I would not have been able to complete it while staying
sane.</para>

<para>Andy Oram, my editor at O'Reilly, was a writer's dream.  Aside
from knowing the field intimately (he suggested many of the topics),
he has the rare gift of knowing what one meant to say and helping one
find the right way to say it.  It has been an honor to work with him.
Thanks also to Chuck Toporek for steering this proposal to Andy right
away.</para>

<para>Brian Fitzpatrick reviewed almost all of the material as I wrote
it, which not only made the book better, but kept me writing when I
wanted to be anywhere in the world but in front of the computer.  Ben
Collins-Sussman and Mike Pilato also checked up on progress, and were
always happy to discuss&mdash;sometimes at length&mdash;whatever topic
I was trying to cover that week.  They also noticed when I slowed
down, and gently nagged when necessary.  Thanks, guys.</para>

<para>Biella Coleman was writing her dissertation at the same time
I was writing this book.  She knows what it means to sit down and
write every day, and provided an inspiring example as well as a
sympathetic ear.  She also has a fascinating anthropologist's-eye view
of the free software movement, giving both ideas and references that I
was able use in the book.  Alex Golub&mdash;another anthropologist
with one foot in the free software world, and also finishing his
dissertation at the same time&mdash;was exceptionally supportive early
on, which helped a great deal.</para>

<para>Micah Anderson somehow never seemed too oppressed by his own
writing gig, which was inspiring in a sick, envy-generating sort of
way, but he was ever ready with friendship, conversation, and (on at
least one occasion) technical support.  Thanks, Micah!</para>

<para>Jon Trowbridge and Sander Striker gave both encouragement and
concrete help&mdash;their broad experience in free software provided
material I couldn't have gotten any other way.</para>

<para>Thanks to Greg Stein not only for friendship and well-timed
encouragement, but for showing the Subversion project how important
regular code review is in building a programming community.  Thanks
also to Brian Behlendorf, who tactfully drummed into our heads the
importance of having discussions publicly; I hope that principle is
reflected throughout this book.</para>

<para>Thanks to Benjamin "Mako" Hill and Seth Schoen, for various
conversations about free software and its politics; to Zack Urlocker
and Louis Suarez-Potts for taking time out of their busy schedules to
be interviewed; to Shane on the Slashcode list for allowing his post
to be quoted; and to Haggen So for his enormously helpful comparison
of canned hosting sites.</para>

<para>Thanks to Alla Dekhtyar, Polina, and Sonya for their unflagging
and patient encouragement.  I'm very glad that I will no longer have
to end (or rather, try unsuccessfully to end) our evenings early to go
home and work on "The Book."</para>

<para>Thanks to Jack Repenning for friendship, conversation, and a
stubborn refusal to ever accept an easy wrong analysis when a harder
right one is available.  I hope that some of his long experience with
both software development and the software industry rubbed off on this
book.</para>

<para>CollabNet was exceptionally generous in allowing me a flexible
schedule to write, and didn't complain when it went on far longer than
originally planned.  I don't know all the intricacies of how
management arrives at such decisions, but I suspect Sandhya Klute, and
later Mahesh Murthy, had something to do with it&mdash;my thanks to
them both.</para>

<para>The entire Subversion development team has been an inspiration
for the past five years, and much of what is in this book I learned
from working with them.  I won't thank them all by name here, because
there are too many, but I implore any reader who runs into a
Subversion committer to immediately buy that committer the drink of
his choice&mdash;I certainly plan to.</para>

<para>Many times I ranted to Rachel Scollon about the state of the
book; she was always willing to listen, and somehow managed to make
the problems seem smaller than before we talked.  That helped a
lot&mdash;thanks.</para>

<para>Thanks (again) to Noel Taylor, who must surely have wondered why
I wanted to write another book given how much I complained the last
time, but whose friendship and leadership of Golos&aacute; helped keep
music and good fellowship in my life even in the busiest times.
Thanks also to Matthew Dean and Dorothea Samtleben, friends and
long-suffering musical partners, who were very understanding as my
excuses for not practicing piled up.  Megan Jennings was constantly
supportive, and genuinely interested in the topic even though it was
unfamiliar to her&mdash;a great tonic for an insecure writer.  Thanks,
pal!</para>

<para>I had four knowledgeable and diligent reviewers for this book:
Yoav Shapira, Andrew Stellman, Davanum Srinivas, and Ben Hyde.  If I
had been able to incorporate all of their excellent suggestions, this
would be a better book.  As it was, time constraints forced me to pick
and choose, but the improvements were still significant.  Any errors
that remain are entirely my own.</para>

<para>My parents, Frances and Henry, were wonderfully supportive as
always, and as this book is less technical than the previous one, I
hope they'll find it somewhat more readable.</para>

<para>Finally, I would like to thank the dedicatees, Karen Underhill
and Jim Blandy.  Karen's friendship and understanding have meant
everything to me, not only during the writing of this book but for the
last seven years.  I simply would not have finished without her help.
Likewise for Jim, a true friend and a hacker's hacker, who first
taught me about free software, much as a bird might teach an airplane
about flying.</para>
