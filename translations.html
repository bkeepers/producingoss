<p>People are already at work translating <cite>Producing Open Source

with a translation, please <a href="feedback.html">let me know</a>.
We'll give you commit access to the

Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to translate, and

<div class="info" id="guidelines" title="guidelines">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Translator guidelines:</p>

<p>These guidelines assume you're familiar with using
the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org" >Subversion</a> version
control system.  If you're not, don't worry: we'll find a way to make
it easy for you to work on the translation, either by teaching you
some Subversion, or by arranging things so that you don't have to use
Subversion.</p>

<p>First, get a username and password for repository access by <a
href="feedback.html">asking here</a>.  Then check out a working copy
of the relevant translation directory, named after the two-letter
standard language code.  In this example, it's <em>zh</em> for
Chinese:</p>

<pre>   $ svn checkout http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/producingoss/trunk/zh/
   $ cd zh
</pre>

<p>The chapters are named <em>ch00.xml</em>, <em>ch01.xml</em>, etc
(and there are a few other XML files, for the table of contents and
the appendices).  Just edit each file, replacing English text with the
target language.  (If your software asks you what format to save in,
choose "UTF8" or "UTF-8".)</p>

<p>Once you've done enough work and you're ready to save, commit the
changes to the repository:</p>

<pre>   $ svn commit -m "Translated some more of Chapter 2." ch02.xml
</pre>

<p>At any time, you can "update" to bring down the changes other
people may have made:</p>

<pre>   $ svn update
</pre>

<hr>

<p>Here are more detailed instructions, for translators who don't have
prior Subversion experience.  (These are taken from an email I posted
to the translators mailing list, and were written for a translator
working under Microsoft Windows.  The full archives of that list are
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/producingoss-translators@red-bean.com/"
>here</a>.  -Karl Fogel).</p>

<pre>   Subversion (<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>, also called "SVN") is a
   version control system, which is used to keep track of all changes to
   the book.  The "master copy" of the book is stored, as XML files, in a
   central repository here:
   
      <a href="http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/producingoss/trunk/">http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/producingoss/trunk/</a>
   
   You can browse the repository with your web browser; Subversion also
   knows how to request a copy of the book from that location.  In
   SVN-speak, we say "check out" for "request a copy".  It's like
   checking out a book from the library.  To check out, you first install
   Subversion software (the Subversion "client") on your own computer,
   and have that client request a copy of the book from the repository.
   
   The client you should use is TortoiseSVN (I'm assuming you're on a
   Windows machine).  TortoiseSVN is at <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/</a>.
   It self-installs like other Windows software.
   
   (Using TortoiseSVN is pretty easy -- you can press F1 at any time, also
   there are manuals in various languages at http://tortoisesvn.net/support.
   I've only read the English, but I highly recommend it, see
   <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/index.html">http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/index.html</a>, especially
   <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-basics.html">http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-basics.html</a>
   for a basic introduction to SVN.)
   
   Fortunately, you don't need to read all those manuals right now.  I'll
   just tell you how to get started :-).
   
   After installing TortoiseSVN, use Windows Explorer to choose a folder
   where you want to put your copy of the book (this will be called your
   "working copy").  Right click to pop up the context menu, and select
   
      TortoiseSVN --&gt; Checkout
   
   This will bring up a dialog box, asking you for a URL and a checkout
   directory.  For the URL, use
   
      <a href="http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/producingoss/trunk/">http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/producingoss/trunk/</a>
   
   and for the checkout folder, pick any name you want (TortoiseSVN will
   create this folder on your local disk).  I recommend
   
      ProducingOSS
   
   or something like that.
   
   Note that you'll only do this checkout process once.  After that,
   you'll be using:
   
      TortoiseSVN --&gt; Update
   
   whenever you want to pull changes from the repository into your
   working copy.  (This is to stay up-to-date with what the other
   translators are doing, especially in your language.)
   
   The initial checkout may take a while, because it gets both the
   English and all the translation folders.  (Technically, there are ways
   to limit it to just your language folder, but I'm assuming you have a
   reasonable amount of disk space and prefer to keep things simple, so
   let's just check out the entire book tree.)
   
   Let's say you have checked out into the folder "ProducingOSS".  Inside
   that folder you'll see things like this:

      ProducingOSS\en
      ProducingOSS\da
      ProducingOSS\ja
      ProducingOSS\es
      ... etc ...
      ProducingOSS\en\ch00.xml
      ProducingOSS\en\ch01.xml
      ProducingOSS\en\ch02.xml
      ... etc ...
      ProducingOSS\es\ch00.xml
      ProducingOSS\es\ch01.xml
      ProducingOSS\es\...
      ... etc ...
      ProducingOSS\pl\ch00.xml
      ProducingOSS\pl\ch01.xml
      ProducingOSS\pl\...
      ... etc ...
   
   etc, etc.
   
   The only files you need to worry about are the ones in your language
   folder ("es").  Most of the files in "es" will still be in English --
   they are direct copies of the English files, and they need to be
   translated.
   
   So just edit one in your favorite text editor, translating as much as
   you want.  When you're done with a session, it's time to send your
   changes back to the repository -- that is, to "commit" your changes.
   Committing stores your changes permanently, and makes them available
   to all the other translators.  Committing also causes an email to be
   sent to this mailing list, showing everyone what you translated; this
   makes it easier for people to review each others' work and get a sense
   of general progress.
   
   In TortoiseSVN, you commit by right-clicking and choosing
   
      TortoiseSVN --&gt; Commit
   
   It will ask you for a message (known as a "log message"), a short note
   that explains what you changed.  You can just say "Translated 9 more
   paragraphs" or whatever.  Your log message can be in the language
   you're translating to, or in English, that's the choice of you and
   your language team.
   
   Periodically, you should also do
   
      TortoiseSVN --&gt; Update
   
   to pull changes from the repository into your working copy.  I
   recommend doing this right before you sit down to do some translation,
   that's often enough.
