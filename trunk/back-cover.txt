Fewer than ten percent of free software projects take hold and achieve
lasting success -- this book tells you how to improve your project's
chances of being one of them.

<em>Producing Free Software</em>, written by long-time developer and
manager Karl Fogel, covers many of the problems that arise in open
source software development.  Perhaps you are a programmer whose small
project has caught on but now needs to grow; or has already grown, to
the point where you're having trouble managing it.  Perhaps you're
having trouble motivating contributors, or are experiencing too much
turnover.  Maybe you inherited a project and are wondering how to keep
it going, or have a proprietary project you'd like to make open.

Fogel has worked with the development teams of many free software
projects, including CVS and GNU Emacs, and most recently managed the
creation of Subversion for CollabNet, Inc.

Topics in <em>Producing Free Software</em> include:

* The technical resources successful free software projects provide to
  developers and users

* Keeping developers productive, cooperative, and happy

* Handling communications efficiently

* Distributing responsibility for bug tracking and fixing

* Effectively funding projects

* Testing and releasing
