<title>Money</title>

<simplesect>

<para>Corporate funding of free software development is not a new
phenemenon.  In fact, a lot of development has always been informally
subsidized.  When a system administrator writes a network analysis
tool to help her do her job, then posts it online and gets bug fixes
and feature contributions from other system administrators, what's
happened is that an unofficial consortium has been formed.  The
consortium's funding comes from the sysadmins' salaries, and its
office space and network bandwidth are donated, albeit unknowingly, by
the organizations they work for.  Those organizations benefit from the
investment, of course, although they may not be institutionally aware
of it at first.</para>

<para>The difference today is that many of these efforts are being
formalized.  Corporations have become conscious of the benefits of
open source software, and started involving themselves more directly
in its development.  The arrival of for-profit resources implies the
arrival of for-profit expectations.  This is not simply a matter of
measuring return on investment.  It is also about management
processes: how can the essentially hierarchical command structures of
corporations and the semi-decentralized volunteer communities of free
software projects work productively with each other?  Will they even
agree on what "productively" means?</para>

<para>Before we go any further, let's be clear what this chapter is
<emphasis>not</emphasis> about: it is not about projects that are
licensed as open source, but run closed-source.  Sometimes a company
will start a free software project, announce it with great fanfare on
<ulink url="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat.net</ulink> and all
the right mailing lists, but never really get developer buy-in from
the outside world.  When you check back a year later, all the
committers are still from that same company, and there are no
significant outside voices on the mailing lists.  The project may be
officially open, its code available to the public at large and
forkable by anyone, but in practice it remains an in-house operation.
There is nothing wrong with this, and I would certainly never argue
against having more free code in the world.  But from a management
perspective, it is not much different from a proprietary project.  The
developers are organized hierarchically, working toward a single
vision defined by the company, and not pressured to negotiate with or
react to outside influences (other than market pressures, of course).
The project may <emphasis>be</emphasis> open source, but it is not
<emphasis>doing</emphasis> open source.  This chapter is about doing
open source &mdash; in particular, about using money effectively in
the presence of an outside development community.</para>

<para>Financial backing is, in general, welcomed by open source
development communities.  By reducing the project's vulnerability the
Forces of Chaos, which sweep away so many projects before they really
get off the ground, it can make people more willing to give the
software a chance &mdash; they feel they're investing their time into
something that will still be around six months from now.  Credibility
is contagious, to a point.  When, say, IBM backs an open source
project, people pretty much assume the project won't be allowed to
fail, and their resultant willingness to devote effort to it can make
that a self-fulfilling prophecy.</para>

<para>However, if not handled carefully, money can divide a project
into in-group and out-group developers.  If the unpaid volunteers get
the feeling that design decisions or feature additions are simply
available to the highest bidder, they'll most likely head off to a
project that seems more like a meritocracy and less like unpaid labor
for someone else's benefit.  They may never complain overtly on the
mailing lists.  Instead, there will simply be less and less noise from
external sources, as the volunteers gradually stop trying to be taken
seriously.  The buzz of small-scale activity will continue, in the
form of bug reports and occasional small fixes.  But there won't be
any large code contributions or outside participation in design
discussions.  People sense what's expected of them, and live up (or
down) to those expectations.</para>

<para>Although money needs to be used carefully, that doesn't mean it
can't buy influence.  It most certainly can.  The trick is that it
can't buy influence directly.  In a straightforward commercial
transaction, you trade money for what you want.  If you need a feature
added, you sign a contract, pay for it, and it gets done.  In an open
source project, it's not so simple.  You may sign a contract with some
developers, but they'd be fooling themselves &mdash; and you &mdash;
if they guaranteed that the work you paid for would be accepted by the
development community simply because you paid for it.  The work can
only be accepted on its own merits and on how it fits into the
community's vision for the software.  You may have some say in that
vision, but you won't be the only voice.</para>

<para>So you can't purchase influence, but you can purchase things
that <emphasis>lead to</emphasis> influence.  The most obvious example
is programmers.  If you hire good programmers, and they stick around
long enough to get experience with the software and credibility in the
community, then they can influence the project by the same means as
any other member.  They will have a vote, or if there are many of
them, they will have a voting bloc.  If they are respected in the
project, they will have influence beyond just their votes.  There is
no need for paid developers to disguise their motives, either.  After
all, everyone who wants a change made to the software wants it for a
reason.  Your company's reasons are no less legitimate than anyone
else's.  It's just that the weight given to your goals will be
determined by your representatives' status in the project, not by your
company's size, budget, or business plan.</para>

<para>Of course, acquiring influence in a project isn't the only
reason to support it financially (even Machiavelli wasn't always
Machiavellian), and there are plenty of ways to help a project besides
paying programmers' salaries.  In the sections that follow, we'll look
at various kinds of corporate involvement.  But usually the
longest-term and stablest investment a corporation makes is in
programmers, so we'll examine that first.</para>

<title>Paid Participation</title>

<para>The question of how to hire programmers, and what kind of
programmers to hire, depends very much on how free software fits into
your company's business model.  There are a number of different ways
for-profit organizations are involved with free software, among
them:</para>

<variablelist>

   <varlistentry><term>Dual-licensing</term>
     <listitem>
     <para>Projects that are funded from royalties driven by a
           dual-licencing model (see <xref
           linkend="pfs-dual-licensing"/>), where those using the
           software in proprietary products subsidize its development
           for the free world.  Examples: MySQL, Sleepycat's Berkeley
           Database.</para>
     <para>Dual-licensing situations get started for a number of
           reasons.  The code may have started out free, and a
           permanent proprietary fork may simply not be in the cards
           (too much negative publicity, too much momentum in the
           existing dev community, whatever).  But also, let's not
           forget the "Where do you want to spend your time?" factor.
           Sometimes, people start these companies because they just
           plain like doing open source development, and don't want to
           give it up.</para>

<sect2 id="pfs-money-vs-love">
<title>Money Can't Buy You Love</title>

<para>If some of the developers in your project are funded, even
partially, then it is very important for you to set guidelines about
what the money can and cannot buy.  This does not mean you need to
post twice a day to the mailing lists reiterating your noble and
incorruptible nature.  It merely means that you should be on the
lookout for opportunities to defuse the tensions that
<emphasis>could</emphasis> be created by money.  You don't need to
start out assuming that the tensions are there; you do need to
demonstrate an awareness that they have the potential to arise.</para>

<para>A perfect example of this came up in the Subversion project.
Subversion was started in 2000 by <ulink
url="http://www.collab.net/">CollabNet</ulink>, which has been the
project's primary funder since its inception, paying the salaries of
several developers (disclaimer: I'm one of them).  Fairly early in the
project, we hired another developer, Mike Pilato, to join the effort.
By then, coding had already started.  Although we were still very much
in the early stages, there was already a development community, with
set of basic ground rules.</para>

<para>Mike's arrival raised an interesting question.  Subversion
already had a policy about how a new developer gets commit access.
First, he submits some patches to the development mailing list.  After
enough patches have gone by for the other committers to see that the
new contributor knows what he's doing, someone proposes that he just
commit directly (the proposal is private, as described in <xref
linkend="pfs-committers"/>).  Assuming the committers agree, someone
mails the new developer and offers him direct commit access to the
project's repository.</para>

<para>CollabNet had hired Mike specifically to work on Subversion.
Among those who already knew him, there was no doubt about his coding
skills or his readiness to work on the project.  Furthermore, the
volunteer developers had a very good relationship with the CollabNet
employees, and most likely would not have objected if we'd just given
Mike commit access the day he was hired.  But we knew we'd be setting
a precedent.  If we granted Mike commit access by fiat, we'd be saying
that CollabNet had the right to ignore project guidelines, simply by
virtue of being the primary funder.  While the damage from this might
not have been immediately apparent, it would gradually result in the
non-salaried developers feeling disenfranchised.  Other people have to
earn their commit access &mdash; CollabNet just buys it.</para>

<para>So Mike agreed to start out his employment at CollabNet like any
other volunteer developer, without commit access.  He sent patches to
the mailing list, where they could be, and were, reviewed by everyone.
Equally importantly, we said on the list that we were doing things
this way deliberately, so there could be no missing the point.  After
a while, someone (I can't remember if it was a CollabNet developer or
not) proposed Mike for commit access, and he was accepted, as everyone
knew he would be.</para>

<para>That kind of consistency gets you a credibility that money could
never buy.  And credibility is a valuable currency to have in
technical discussions: it's immunization against having ones motives
questioned later.  In the heat of argument, people will sometimes look
for non-technical ways to win the battle.  The project's primary
funder, because of its deep involvement and obvious concern over the
directions the project takes, presents a wider target than most.  By
being scrupulous to observe all project guidelines right from the
start, the funder makes itself the same size as everyone else.</para>

<para><remark>(Remark on how some sort of non-BD-based project
organization may be more robust in this sort of situation.  A funded
BD is probably the worst of all possible worlds.)</remark></para>

<title>Contracting</title>

<para> Contracting.  You may have funding, but that doesn't mean it's
easy to disburse.  Subcontracting needs to be done carefully in free
software projects, because part of the deal is that the
subcontractor's work must be accepted by the community -- and just
because someone funded the work doesn't necessarily mean the community
will accept it!  [Tell the story of CVS pserver here?]  </para>

<para><remark>By the way, don't think of community acceptance as an
obstacle to be overcome.  Rather, think of it as a free QA department.
The CVS pserver protocol story shows the dangers of not aggressively
taking advantage of that free QA.</remark></para>

<sect1 id="pfs-funding-non-dev">
<title>Funding Non-Development Activities</title>

<para>There are certain aspects of software development that open
source volunteers tend not to get around to.  The volunteers who get
involved with projects are usually programmers, and their primary
interests are writing code and debugging.  If your goal is just to
help a project succeed, one of the best ways is to fund activities
that are typically be neglected the volunteer community.</para>

The general idea is to use funding to make things happen that
otherwise <emphasis>wouldn't</emphasis> happen in open source
development.  Useability testing, QA, thorough documentation, etc.

Open source programs are widely alleged to have poor user
interfaces (although I think this is often a canard &mdash; what they
have are <emphasis>different</emphasis> user interfaces

<para><remark>The key with all of these is to integrate them into the
development community, by using a little preparation.  Use your
salaried developers as a liason.  Don't just have the marketing
department send out papers, get them fact-checked and also
*politics*-checked first.  Make sure the QA people know how to use the
project's public bug tracker, and make sure the community sees that
these resources are being devoted to the project.)</remark></para>
