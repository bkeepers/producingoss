<div class="info">

<p>Please enter comments and suggestions about the book or this
website into our <a
href="http://www.red-bean.com/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi">Bugzilla bug
database</a>, project name "<em>producingoss</em>".</p>

<p>You will need to create a Bugzilla account.  This only takes a
minute; just follow the on-screen instructions.  Once you have an
account, you can use it for all future feedback&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;that
is, you only create an account once, not every time you want to send
in a suggestion.</p>

<h4>Why a bug tracker instead of email?</h4>

<p>Suggestions often need to be integrated with one another before
being implemented, which is much easier if they are recorded in a
single database.  Also, using a tracker makes it easy for anyone to
browse existing comments and suggestions, which enables people to find
out if the feedback they were about to send has already been sent by
someone else.</p>

<p>If this book were a full-fledged open source project, it would have
mailing lists, file-sharing areas, archives, and all the <a
href="http://producingoss.com/html-chunk/technical-infrastructure.html"
>usual stuff</a>.  However, it's somewhere between a single-author
work and a collaborative project, so its supporting infrastructure is
designed to make things easy for the primary maintainer.  As a special
exception, if you know my personal email address and can't stand the
thought of using the bug tracker, then just mail your comments to me,
and I'll take it from there.</p>
