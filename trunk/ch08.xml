<title>Managing Volunteers</title>

<simplesect>

<para>Getting people to agree on what a project needs, and to work
together to achieve it, requires more than just a genial atmosphere
and a lack of obvious dysfunction.  It requires someone, or several
someones, consciously managing all the people involved.  Managing
volunteers may not be a technical craft in the same sense as computer
programming, but it is a craft in the sense that it can be improved
through study and practice.  This chapter is a grab-bag of specific
techniques for managing volunteers.  It draws, perhaps more heavily
than previous chapters, on the Subversion project as a case study,
partly because I am working on that project as I write this and have
all the primary sources close at hand, and partly because it's more
acceptable to cast critical stones into one's own glass house than
into others'.  But I have also seen in various other projects the
benefits of applying&mdash;and consequences of not applying&mdash;the
recommendations that follow; when it is politically feasible to give
examples from some of those other projects, I will do so.</para>

<para>Speaking of politics, this is as good a time as any to drag that
much-maligned word out for a closer look.  Many engineers like to
think of politics as something other people engage in.
"<emphasis>I'm</emphasis> just advocating the best course for the
project, but <emphasis>she's</emphasis> raising objections for
political reasons."  I believe this distaste of politics (or of what
is imagined to be politics) is especially strong in engineers because
engineers are bought into the idea that some solutions are objectively
superior to others.  Thus, when someone acts in a way that seems
motivated by other considerations&mdash;say, the maintenance of their
own position of influence, or the lessening of someone else's
influence, or outright horse-trading, or avoiding hurting someone's
feelings&mdash;other participants in the project may get annoyed.  Of
course, this rarely prevents those others from behaving in the same
way when their own vital interests are at stake.</para>

<para>If you consider "politics" a dirty word, and hope to keep your
project free of it, give up right now.  Politics are inevitable
whenever people have to cooperatively manage a shared resource.  It is
absolutely rational that one of the considerations going into each
person's decision-making processes is the question of how a given
action might affect their own future influence in the project.  After
all, if you trust your own judgement and skills, as most programmers
do, then the potential loss of future influence has to be considered a
technical result, in a sense.  Similar reasoning applies to other
behaviors that might seem on their face like "pure" politics.  In
fact, there is no such thing as pure politics: it is precisely because
actions have real-world consequences that people become politically
conscious in the first place.  Politics is, in the end, simply an
acknowledgement that <emphasis>all</emphasis> consequences of
decisions must be taken into account.  If a particular decision leads
to a result that most participants find technically satisfying, but
involves a change in power relationships that leaves key people
feeling isolated, then the latter is just as important a result as the
former.  To fail to consider it would not be high-minded, but
short-sighted.</para>

<para>So as you read the advice that follows, and as you work with
your own project, remember that there is <emphasis>no one</emphasis>
who is not playing politics.  Appearing to be above politics is merely
one particular political strategy, and sometimes a very useful one,
but it is never the reality.  Politics is simply what happens when
people disagree, and successful projects are those that evolve
political mechanisms for managing disagreement constructively.</para>

<sect1 id="pfs-volunteers">
<title>Getting the Most Out of Volunteers</title>

<para>Why do volunteers work on free software projects?</para>

<para>When asked, many claim they do it because they want to produce
good software, or want to be personally involved in fixing the bugs
that matter to them.  But these reasons are usually not the whole
story.  After all, could you imagine a volunteer staying with a
project even if no one ever said a word in appreciation of her work,
or listened to her in discussions?  Of course not.  Clearly, people
spend time on free software for reasons beyond just an abstract desire
to produce good code.  Understanding volunteers' true motivations will
help you arrange things so as to attract and keep them.  The desire to
produce good software may be among those motivations, along with the
challenge and educational value of working on hard problems.  But
humans also have a built-in desire to work with other humans, and to
give and earn respect through cooperative activities.  Groups engaged
in cooperative activities must evolve norms of behavior such that
status is acquired and kept through actions which help the group's
goals.  Those norms won't always arise by themselves.  There are
projects&mdash;experienced open source developers can probably name
several off the tops of their heads&mdash;in which people apparently
feel that status is acquired by posting frequently and verbosely, for
example.  They don't come to this conclusion accidentally; they come
to it because they are rewarded with respect for making long,
articulate arguments, whether or not that actually helps the project.
Following are some techniques for creating an atmosphere in which
status-acquiring actions are also constructive actions.</para>

<!-- ======================== subsection ============================== -->
<sect2 id="pfs-delegation">
<title>Delegation</title>

<para>Delegation is not merely a way to spread the workload around; it
is also a political and social tool.  Consider all the effects when
you ask someone to do something.  The most obvious effect is that, if
she accepts, she does the task and you don't.  But another effect is
that she is made aware that you trusted her to handle the task.
Furthermore, if you made the request in a public forum, then she knows
that others in the group have been made aware of that trust too.  She
may also feel some pressure to accept, depending on how you asked, and
if she doesn't really want the job, this can become a source of
resentment.  The task may require coordination with others in the
project, in which case you are effectively proposing that this person
become more involved, form bonds that might not otherwise have been
formed, and perhaps become a source of authority in some subdomain of
the project.  The added involvement may be daunting, or it may lead
the person to become engaged in other ways as well, from an increased
feeling of overall commitment.</para>

<para>Because of all these effects, it often makes sense to ask
someone else to do something even when you know you could do it faster
or better yourself.  Of course, there is sometimes a strict economic
efficiency argument for this anyway: perhaps the opportunity cost of
doing it yourself would be too high&mdash;there might be something
even more important you could do with that time.  But even when the
opportunity cost argument doesn't apply, you may
<emphasis>still</emphasis> want to ask someone else to take on the
task, because in the long run you want to draw that person deeper into
the project, even if it means spending extra time watching over them
at first.  Delegation is not just about getting things done, it's also
about drawing people into a closer committment to the project.</para>

<sect3 id="pfs-delegation-assignment">
<title>Distinguish clearly between inquiry and assignment</title>

<para>Sometimes it is fair to expect that a person will accept a
particular task.  For example, if someone writes a bug, or commits
some code that fails to comply with project guidelines in some obvious
way, then it is enough to point out the problem and thereafter behave
as though you assume the person will take care of it.  But there are
other situations where it is by no means clear that you have a right
to expect action.  The person may do as you ask, or may not.  Since no
one wants to be taken for granted, you need to be be sensitive to the
difference between these two types of situations, and tailor your
requests accordingly.</para>

<para>One thing that almost always causes people instant annoyance is
being asked to do something in a way that implies that you think it is
clearly their responsibility to do it, when they feel otherwise.  For
example, assignment of incoming issues is particularly fertile ground
for this kind of annoyance.  The participants in a project usually
know who is expert in what areas, so when a bug report comes in, there
will often be one or two people whom everyone knows could probably fix
it quickly.  However, if you assign the issue over to one of those
people without their prior permission, they may feel they have been
put into an uncomfortable position.  They sense the pressure of
expectation, but also may feel that they are, in effect, being
punished for their expertise.  After all, the way one acquires
expertise is by fixing bugs, so perhaps someone else should take this
one!  (Note that issue trackers that automatically assign issues to
particular people based on information in the bug report are less
likely to offend, because everyone knows that the assignment was made
by an automated process, and is not an indication of human
expectations.)</para>

<para>While it would be nice to spread the load as evenly as possible,
there are certain times when you just want to encourage the person who
can fix a bug the fastest to do so.  Given that you can't afford a
communications turnaround for every such assignment ("Would you be
willing to look at this bug?"  "Yes."  "Okay, I'm assigning the issue
over to you then." "Okay."), you should simply make the assignment in
the form of an inquiry, conveying no pressure.  Virtually all issue
trackers allow a comment to be associated with the assignment of an
issue.  In that comment, you can say something like this:</para>

<blockquote>
   <para>Assigning this over to you, jrandom, because you're most
   familiar with this code.  Feel free to bounce this back if you
   don't have time to look at it, though.  (And let me know if you'd
   prefer not to receive such requests in the future.)</para>
</blockquote>

<para>This distinguishes clearly between the
<emphasis>request</emphasis> for assignation and the
recipient's <emphasis>acceptance</emphasis> of that assignation.  The
audience isn't only the assignee, it's everyone: both the assignee and
the group see a public confirmation of the assignee's expertise, but
the message makes it clear that it's up to the assignee whether or not
to accept the responsibility.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="pfs-delegation-followup">
<title>Follow up after you delegate</title>

<para>When you ask someone to do something, remember that you have
done so, and follow up no matter what.  Most requests are made in
public forums, and are roughly of the form "Can you take care of X?
Let us know either way; no problem if you can't, just need to know."
You may or may not get a response.  If you do, and the response is
negative, then the loop is closed&mdash;you'll need to try some other
strategy for dealing with X.  If there is a positive response, then
keep an eye out for progress on the issue, and comment on the progress
you do or don't see (everyone works better when they know someone else
is appreciating their work).  If there is no response, then after a
few days, ask again, or just post saying that you got no response and
are looking for someone else to do it.  Or just do it yourself, but
still make sure to say that you got no response to the initial
inquiry.</para>

<para>The purpose of publicly noting the lack of response is
<emphasis>not</emphasis> to humiliate the person, and your remarks
should be phrased so as never to have that effect.  The purpose is
simply to show that you keep track of what you have asked for, and
that you notice the reactions you get.  This makes people more likely
to say yes next time, because they will observe (even if only
unconsciously) that you are likely to notice any work they do, given
that you noticed the much less visible event of someone failing to
respond.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="pfs-delegation-interest">
<title>Notice what people are interested in</title>

<para>Another thing that makes people happy is to have their interests
noticed&mdash;in general, the more aspects of someone's personality
you notice and remember, the more comfortable they will be, and the
more they will want to work with groups of which you are a
part.</para>

<para>For example, there was a sharp distinction in the Subversion
project between people who wanted to reach a definitive 1.0 release
(which we eventually did), and people who mainly wanted to add new
features and work on interesting problems but who didn't much care
when 1.0 came out.  Neither of these positions is better or worse than
the other; they're just two different kinds of developers, and both
kinds do lots of work on the project.  But we swiftly learned that it
was important to <emphasis>not</emphasis> assume that the excitement
of the 1.0 drive was shared by everyone.  Electronic media can be very
deceptive: you may sense an atmosphere of shared purpose, when in fact
it's shared only by the people you happen to have been talking to,
while others have completely different priorities.</para>

<para>The more aware you are of what people want out of the project,
the more effectively you can make requests of them.  Even just
demonstrating an understanding of what they want, without making any
associated request, is useful, in that it confirms to each person that
they're not just another particle in an undifferentiated mass.</para>

</sect3>

</sect2>

<!-- ======================== subsection ============================== -->
<sect2 id="pfs-praise-and-criticism">
<title>Praise and Criticism</title>

<para>Praise and criticism are more similar than they are different.
Both are primarily forms of attention, and are most effective when
specific rather than generic.  Both should be deployed with concrete
goals in mind.  Both can be diluted by inflation: praise too much or
too often and you will devalue your praise; the same can be true for
criticism, though in practice criticism is usually reactive and
therefore somewhat more resistant to devaluation.</para>

<para>An important feature of technical culture is that detailed,
dispassionate criticism is often taken as a kind of praise (as
discussed in <xref linkend="pfs-rudeness"/>), because of the
implication that the recipient's work is worth the time required to
analyze it.  However, both of those
conditions&mdash;<emphasis>detailed</emphasis>,
<emphasis>dispassionate</emphasis>&mdash;must be met for this to be
true.  For example, if someone makes a sloppy change to the code, it
is useless (actually, harmful) to follow up saying simply "That was
sloppy."  Sloppiness is ultimately a characteristic of a
<emphasis>person</emphasis>, not of their work, and it's important to
keep your reactions focussed on the work.  It's much more effective to
describe all the things wrong with the change, tactfully and without
malice.  If this is the third or fourth careless change in a row by
the same person, it's appropriate to say that&mdash;again without
anger&mdash;at the end of your critique, to make it clear that the
pattern has been noticed.</para>

<para>If someone does not improve in response to criticism, the
solution is not more or stronger criticism.  The solution is for the
group to remove that person from the position of incompetence, in a
way that minimizes hurt feelings as much as possible; see
<xref linkend="pfs-committers"/> for example.  That is a rare
occurrence, however.  Most people respond pretty well to criticism
that is specific, detailed, and contains a clear (even if unspoken)
expectation of improvement.</para>

<para><remark>(Is that the right cross-reference above?  Perhaps
<xref linkend="pfs-redelegation"/>, or a combination of the two, would
be better.)</remark></para>

<para>Praise won't hurt anyone's feelings, of course, but that doesn't
mean it should be used any less carefully than criticism.  Praise is a
tool: before you use it, ask yourself <emphasis>why</emphasis> you
want to use it.  As a rule, it's not a good idea to praise people for
doing what they usually do, or for actions that are a normal and
expected part of participating in the group.  If you were to do that,
it would be hard to know when to stop: should you praise
<emphasis>everyone</emphasis> for doing the usual things?  After all,
if you leave some people out, they'll wonder why.  It's much better to
express praise and gratitude sparingly, in response to unusual or
unexpected efforts, with the intention of encouraging more such
efforts.  When a participant seems to have moved permanently into a
state of higher productivity, then adjust your praise threshold for
that person accordingly.  Repeated praise for normal behavior
gradually becomes meaningless anyway.  Instead, that person should
sense that their high level of productivity is now considered normal
and natural for them, and only work that goes beyond even that should
be specially noticed.</para>

<para>This is not to say that the person's contributions shouldn't be
acknowledged, of course.  But remember that if the project is set up
right, everything that person does is already visible anyway, and so
the group will know (and the person will know that the rest of the
group knows) everything she does.  There are also ways to acknowledge
someone's work by means other than direct praise.  You could mention
in passing, while discussing a related topic, that she has done a lot
of work in the given area and is the resident expert there; or you
could publicly consult her on some question about the code; or perhaps
most effectively, you could conspicuously make further use of the work
she has done, so she sees that others are now comfortable relying on
the results of her work.  But it's probably not necessary to do these
things in any calculated way.  Someone who regularly makes large
contributions in a project will know it, and will occupy a position of
influence by default.  There's usually no need to take explicit steps
to ensure this, unless you sense that, for whatever reason, it's not
happening as much as it should.</para>

</sect2>

<!-- ======================== subsection ============================== -->
<sect2 id="pfs-territoriality">
<title>Prevent Territoriality</title>

<para>Watch out for participants who try to stake out exclusive
ownership of certain areas of the project, and who seem to want to do
all the work in those areas, to the extent of taking over work that
others try to do.  Such behavior may even seem healthy at first: after
all, on the surface it looks like someone taking on more
responsibility for a particular area, and correlates with increased
activity within that area, by the person staking the claim.  But in
the long run, it is destructive.  When people sense a "no trespassing"
sign, they stay away.  This results in reduced review in that area,
and greater fragility, because the lone developer becomes a single
point of failure.  Worse, it fractures the cooperative, egalitarian
spirit of the project.  The theory must always be that any developer
is welcome to help out on any task at any time.  Of course, in
practice things work a bit differently: people do have areas where
they are more and less influential, and non-experts voluntarily defer
to experts in certain domains of the project.  But the key is that
this is all voluntary: informal authority is granted based on
competence and proven judgement, but it should never be actively
<emphasis>taken</emphasis>.  Even if the person desiring the authority
really is competent, it is still crucial that she hold that authority
informally, through the consensus of the group, and that the authority
never cause her to exclude others from working in that area.</para>

<para>Rejecting or editing someone's work for technical reasons is an
entirely different matter, of course.  But there the decisive factor
is the content of the work, not who happened to act as gatekeeper.  It
could have been anyone.  It may be that the same person happens to do
most of the reviewing for a given area, but as long as they never try
to prevent someone else from doing that work too, things are probably
okay.</para>

<para>In order to combat incipient territorialism, or even the
appearance of it, many projects have taken the step of banning the
inclusion of author names or designated maintainer names in source
files.  I wholeheartedly agree with this practice: we do it in the
Subversion project, and other projects that do it include <remark>[get
list from Sander Striker]</remark>.  A software project's source code
files are the core of its identity.  They should reflect the fact that
the developer community as a whole is responsible for them, and never
be divided up into little fiefdoms.</para>

<para>People sometimes argue in favor of author or maintainer tags in
source files, on the grounds that this gives visible credit to those
who have done the most work there.  There are two problems with this
argument.  First, the tags inevitably raise the awkward question of
how much work one must do to get one's own name listed there too.
Second, they conflate the issue of credit with that of authority:
having done work in the past does not imply ownership of the area
where the work was done, but it's difficult if not impossible to avoid
such an implication when individual names are listed at the tops of
source files.  In any case, credit information can already be obtained
from the version control logs and other out-of-band mechanisms like
mailing list archives, so no information is lost by banning it from
the source files themselves.</para>

<para>If your project decides to keep individual names out of source
files, make sure not to go overboard.  For instance, many projects
have <filename>contrib/</filename> area where small tools and helper
scripts are kept, often written by people who are otherwise not
associated with the project.  It's fine for those files to contain
author names, because they are not really maintained by the project as
a whole.  On the other hand, if a contributed tool starts getting
hacked on by other people in the project, eventually you may want to
move it to a less separated location and, assuming the original author
approves, remove the author's name, so that the code looks like any
other community-maintained resource.  If the author is sensitive about
this, compromise solutions are acceptable, for example:</para>

<blockquote>
<programlisting>
# indexclean.py: Remove old data from a Scanley index.
#
# Original Author: K. Maru &lt;kobayashi@yetanotheremailservice.com&gt;
# Now Maintained By: The Scanley Project &lt;http://www.scanley.org/&gt; and K. Maru.
# 
# ...
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

<para>But it would be better to such compromises, if possible, and
most authors are willing to be persuaded, because they're happy that
their contribution is being made a more integral part of the
project.</para>

<para>The important thing is to remember that there is a continuum
between the core and the periphery of any project.  The main source
code files for the software are clearly part of the core, and should
be considered as maintained by the community.  On the other hand,
companion tools or pieces of documentation may be the work of single
individuals, who maintain them essentially alone, even though the
works may be associated with, and even distributed with, the project.
There is no need to apply a one-size-fits-all rule to every file, as
long as the principle that community-maintained resources are not
allowed to become individual territories is upheld.</para>

</sect2>

<!-- ======================== subsection ============================== -->
<sect2 id="pfs-automation">
<title>The Automation Ratio</title>

<para>Try not to let humans do what machines could do instead.  As a
rule of thumb, automating a common task is worth at least 10 times the
effort a developer would spend doing that task manually one time.  For
very frequent or very complex tasks, that ratio could easily go up to
20 or even higher.</para>

<para>Thinking of yourself as a "project manager", rather than just
another developer, may be a useful attitude here.  Sometimes
individual developers are too wrapped up in low-level work to see the
big picture and realize that everyone is wasting a lot of effort
performing automatable tasks manually.  Even those who do realize it
may not take the time to solve the problem: because each individual
performance of the task does not feel like a huge burden, no one ever
gets annoyed enough to do anything about it.  What makes automation
compelling is that that small burden is multiplied by the number of
times each developer incurs it, and then <emphasis>that</emphasis>
number is multiplied by the number of developers.</para>

<para>Here I am using the term "automation" broadly, to mean not only
repeated actions where one or two variables change each time, but any
sort of technical infrastructure that assists humans.  The minimum
standard automation required to run a project these days was described
in <xref linkend="pfs-ch-3"/>, but each project may have its own
special problems too.  For example, a group working on documentation
might want to a have a web site displaying the most up-to-date
versions of the documents at all times.  Since documentation is often
written in a markup language like XML, there may be a compilation
step, often quite intricate, involved in creating displayable or
downloadable documents.  Arranging a web site where such compilation
happens automatically on every commit can be complicated and
time-consuming&mdash;but it is worth it, even if it costs you a day or
more to set up.  The overall benefits of having up-to-date pages
available at all times are huge, even though the cost
of <emphasis>not</emphasis> having them might seem like only a small
annoyance at any single moment, to any single developer.</para>

<para>The badness that results from failing to take such steps is not
merely wasted time, but the griping and frustration that ensue when
humans make missteps (as they inevitably will) in trying to perform
complicated procedures manually.  Multi-step, deterministic operations
are exactly what computers were invented for; save your humans for
more interesting things.</para>

<sect3 id="pfs-automated-testing">
<title>Automated Testing</title>

<para>Automated test runs are helpful for any software project, but
especially so for open-source projects, because automated testing
(especially regression testing) allows developers to feel comfortable
changing code in areas they are unfamiliar with, and thus encourages
exploratory development.  Since detection of breakage is so hard to do
by hand&mdash;one essentially has to guess where one might have broken
something, and try various experiments to prove that one
didn't&mdash;having automated ways to detect such breakage saves the
project a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of time.  It also makes people much
more relaxed about refactoring large swaths of code, and therefore
contributes to the software's long-term maintainability.</para>

  <sidebar id="pfs-regression-testing">
  <title>Regression Testing</title>

  <para><firstterm>Regression testing</firstterm> means testing for
  the reappearance of bugs.  The purpose of regression testing to
  reduce the chances that code changes will break the software in
  unexpected way.  As a software project gets bigger and more
  complicated, the chances of such unexpected side-effects increase
  steadily.  Good design can reduce the rate at which the chances
  increase, but it cannot eliminate the problem entirely.</para>

  <para>As a result, many projects have a <firstterm>test
  suite</firstterm>, a separate program that invokes the project's
  software in ways that have been known in the past to stimulate
  specific bugs.  If the test suite succeeds in making one of these
  bugs happen, this is known as a <firstterm>regression</firstterm>,
  meaning that someone's change unexpectedly unfixed a
  previously-fixed bug.</para>

  <para>See also
  <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing"/>.</para>

  </sidebar>

<para>Regression testing is not a panacea.  For one thing, it works
best for programs with batch-style interfaces.  Software that is
operated primarily through graphical user interfaces is much harder to
drive programmatically.  Another problem is that the regression test
suite framework itself can often be quite complex, with a learning
curve and maintenance burden all its own.  Reducing this complexity is
one of the most useful things you can do, even though it may take a
considerable amount of time.  The easier it is to add new tests to the
suite, the more developers will do so, and the fewer bugs will survive
to release.  Any effort spent making tests easier to write will be
paid back manyfold over the lifetime of the project.</para>

<para>Many projects have a <firstterm>"Don't break the
build!"</firstterm> rule, meaning, don't commit a change that makes
the software unable to compile or run.  Being the person who broke the
build is usually cause for mild embarrassment and ribbing.  Projects
with regression test suites often have a corollary rule: don't commit
any change that causes tests to fail.  Such failures are easiest to
spot if there are automatic nightly runs of the entire test suite,
with the results mailed out to the development list or to a dedicated
test-results mailing list; that's another example of a worthwhile
automation.</para>

<para>Some projects go even further, requiring that new a test
accompany <emphasis>every</emphasis> bugfix or new feature.  Whether
this is a good idea or not depends on many factors: the nature of the
software, the makeup of the development team, and the difficulty of
writing new tests.  For many years, the CVS
(<ulink url="http://www.cvshome.org/"/>) project had a hard rule that
no non-trivial change could be committed to the source code without a
corresponding addition to the regression suite, to test that the
change worked.  This was a good policy in theory, since CVS is version
control software and therefore properly conservative about the
possibility of munging or mishandling the user's data.  The problem in
practice was that CVS's regression test suite is a single huge shell
script (amusingly named <filename>sanity.sh</filename>), hard to read
and even harder to modify or extend.  The difficulty of adding new
tests, combined with the requirement that patches be accompanied by
new tests, meant that CVS effectively discouraged a lot of code
contributions.  More than once I saw people start on and even complete
a patch to CVS itself, but give up when told of the requirement to add
a new test to <filename>sanity.sh</filename>.  Worse, I knew from
conversations with experienced developers that they occasionally
didn't bother to fix minor bugs because the trouble to write a new
test would be too great.  (Not having worked on CVS in a while, I
don't know how strictly the developer community enforces the test
requirement these days, although it is still listed in the official
documentation.)</para>

<para>It is normal to spend more time writing a new regression test
than on fixing the original bug.  But CVS carried this phenomenon to
an extreme: one might spend hours trying to design one's test
properly, and still get it wrong, because there are just too many
unpredictable complexities involved in changing a 35,000 line Bourne
shell script.  Even longtime CVS developers often grumbled when they
had to add a new test.</para>

<para>This situation was due to a failure on all our parts to consider
the automation ratio.  It is true that designing and implementing a
new test framework would have been a major
effort.<footnote><para>Although note that there would be no need to
convert all the existing tests to the new framework; the two could
happily exist side by side, with old tests converted over only as they
needed to be changed.</para></footnote> But neglecting to do so has
cost the project much more, over the years.  How many bugfixes and new
features are <emphasis>not</emphasis> in CVS today, because of the
impediment of an awkward test suite?  We cannot know the exact number,
but it is surely many times greater than the number of bugfixes or new
features the developers might forgo in order to come up with a new
test system (or integrate an off-the-shelf system).  That task would
only take a finite amount of time, while the penalty of using the
current test suite will continue forever if nothing is done.</para>

<para>The point is not that having strict requirements to write tests
is bad, nor that writing your test system in Bourne shell script is
necessarily bad.  It might work fine, depending on how you design it
and and what it needs to test.  The point is simply that when the test
system becomes a significant impediment to development, something must
be done.</para>

<para>Most volunteer developers are willing to take the extra time to
write regression tests, when the test system is comprehensible and
easy to work with.  Accompanying changes with tests is understood to
be the responsible thing to do, and it's also an easy opportunity for
collaboration: often two developers will divide up the work for a
bugfix, with one writing the fix itself, and the other writing the
test.  The latter developer may often end up with more work, and since
writing a test is already less satisfying than fixing an actual bug,
it is imperative that the test suite not make the experience more
painful than it has to be.</para>

<sect2 id="pfs-users-to-volunteers">
<title>Treat Every User as a Potential Volunteer</title>

<para>Each interaction with a user is an opportunity to get a new
volunteer.  When a user takes the time to post to one of the project's
mailing lists, or to file a bug report, she has already tagged herself
as having more potential for involvement than most users (from whom
the project will never hear at all).  Follow up on that potential: if
she described a bug, thank her for the report and ask her if she wants
to try fixing it.  If she wrote to say that an important question was
missing from the FAQ, or that the program's documentation was
deficient in some way, then freely acknowledge the problem (assuming
it really exists) and ask if she's interested in writing the missing
material herself.  Naturally, much of the time the user will demur,
but it doesn't cost much to ask, and every time you do, it reminds the
other listeners in that forum that getting involved in the project is
something anyone can do.</para>

<para>Don't limit your goals to acquiring new developers and
documentation writers.  For example, even training people to write
good bug reports pays off in the long run, if you don't spend
<emphasis>too</emphasis> much time per person, and if they go on
to submit more bug reports in the future&mdash;which they are more
likely to do if they got a constructive reaction to their first
report.  A constructive reaction need not be a fix for the bug,
although that's always the ideal; it can also be a solicitation for
more information, or even just a confirmation that the behavior
<emphasis>is</emphasis> a bug.  People want to be listened to.
Secondarily, they want their bugs fixed.  You may not always be able
to give them the latter in a timely fashion, but you (or rather, the
project as a whole) can give them the former.</para>

<para>A corollary of this is that developers should not express anger
at people who file well-intended but vague bug reports.  This is one
of my personal pet peeves; I see developers do it all the time on
various open source mailing lists, and the harm it does is palpable.
Some hapless newbie will post a useless report:</para>

<blockquote>
   <para>Hi, I can't get Scanley to run.  Every time I start it up, it
   just errors.  Is anyone else seeing this problem?</para>
</blockquote>

<para>And some developer&mdash;who has seen this kind of report a
thousand times, and hasn't stopped to think that the newbie has
not&mdash;will respond like this:</para>

<blockquote>
   <para>What are we supposed to do with so little information?
   Sheesh.  Give us at least some details, like the version of
   Scanley, your operating system, and the error.</para>
</blockquote>

<para>This developer has failed to see things from the user's point of
view, and also failed to consider the effect such a reaction might
have on all the <emphasis>other</emphasis> people watching the
exchange.  Naturally a user who has no programming experience, and no
prior experience reporting bugs, will not know how to write a bug
report.  What is the right way to handle such a person?  Educate them!
And do it in such a way that they come back for more:</para>

<blockquote>
   <para>Sorry you're having trouble.  We'll need more information in
   order to figure out what's happening here.  Please tell us the
   version of Scanley, your operating system, and the exact text of
   the error.  The very best thing you can do is send a transcript
   show the exact commands you ran, and the output they produced.
   See http://www.scanley.org/how_to_report_a_bug.html for more.</para> 
</blockquote>

<para>This way of responding is far more effective, in terms of
extracting the needed information from the user, because it is written
to the user's point of view.  First, it expresses sympathy:
<emphasis>You had a problem; we feel your pain</emphasis>.  (This is
not necessary in every bug report response, it depends on the severity
of the problem and how upset the user seemed.)  Second, instead of
belittling her for not knowing how to report a bug, it tells her how,
and in enough detail to be actually useful&mdash;for example, many
users don't realize that "show us the error" means "show us the exact
text of the error, with no omissions or abridgements".  The first time
you work with such a user, you need to be specific about that.
Finally, it offers a pointer to much more detailed and complete
instructions for reporting bugs.  If you have successfully engaged
with the user, she will often take the time to read that document and
do what it says.  This means, of course, that you have to have the
document prepared in advance.  It should give clear instructions about
what kind of information your development team wants to see in every
bug report.  Ideally, it should also evolve over time in response to
the particular sorts of omissions and misreports users tend to make
for your project.</para>

<para>The Subversion project's bug reporting instructions are a fairly
standard example of the form, see <xref linkend="pfs-app-d"/>.  Notice
how they close with an invitation to provide a patch to fix the bug.
This is not because such an invitation will lead to a greater
patch/report ratio&mdash;most users who are capable of fixing bugs
already know that a patch would be welcome, and don't need to be told.
The invitation's real purpose is to emphasize to all readers,
especially those new to the project or new to free software in
general, that the project runs on volunteer contributions.  In a
sense, the project's current developers are no more responsible for
fixing the bug than is the person who reported it.  This is an
important point that many new users will not be familiar with.  Once
they realize it, they're more likely to help make the fix happen, if
not by contributing code then by providing a more thorough
reproduction recipe, or by offering to test fixes that other people
post.  The goal is to make every user realize that there is
no <emphasis>innate</emphasis> difference between themselves and the
people who work on the project&mdash;that it's a question of how much
time and effort one puts in, not a question of who one is.</para>

<para>The admonition against responding angrily does not apply to rude
users.  Sometimes people post bug reports or complaints that,
regardless of their informational content, show a sneering contempt at
the project for whatever failing the user happens to be posting about.
Often such people are alternately insulting and flattering, such as
the person who posted this to a Subversion mailing list:</para>

<blockquote>
<screen>
Why is it that after almost 6 days there still aren't any binaries posted
for the windows platform?!?  It's the same story every time and it's pretty
frustrating.  Why aren't these things automated so that they could be
available immediately??  When you post an "RC" build, I think the idea is
that you want users to test the build, but yet you don't provide any way of
doing so.  Why even have a soak period if you provide no means of testing??
</screen> 
</blockquote>

<para>Initial response to this rather inflammatory post was
surprisingly restrained: people pointed out that the project had a
published policy of not providing official binaries, and said, with
varying degrees of annoyance, that he ought to volunteer to produce
them himself if they were so important to him.  Believe it or not, his
next post started with these lines:</para>

<blockquote>
<screen>
First of all, let me say that I think Subversion is awesome and I really
appreciate the efforts of everyone involved.  [...]
</screen> 
</blockquote>

<para>... and then he went on berate the project again for not
providing binaries, while still not volunteering to do anything about
it.  After that, about fifty people just jumped all over him, and I
can't say I really minded.  The "zero-tolerance" policy toward
rudeness advocated in <xref linkend="pfs-prevent-rudeness"/> applies
to people with whom the project has (or would like to have) a
sustained interaction.  But when someone makes it clear from the start
that they are going to be a fountain of bile, there is no point making
them feel welcome.</para>

<para>Such situations are fortunately quite rare, and they are
noticeably rarer in projects that make an effort to engage users
constructively and courteously from their very first
interaction.</para>

   Letting volunteers share the management burden as well as the

       - patch management
       - bug management
       - release management
       - documentation and FAQ maintenance
       - distributing meta-management tasks. 
       - mailing list moderation
         Note the interface conundrum here: it's more convenient to
         get moderation mails by email, but that makes it harder to
         parallelize, since it's "mail" style not "news" style.  If
         the posts appear somewhere in a centralized list, you have
         the inconvenience of having to go visit that list, but at
         least the list is up-to-date w.r.t. whatever other
         moderation others have done.  Sigh.  (Gnus is actually the
         best candidate, since it can do both mail and news, heh :-)
         However, note that if done as news, there would have to be
         a global reject mark -- once something is evaluated as spam,
         no one should ever have to look at it again.)

<para><remark>Regarding bug management: full issue sweeps become less
and less feasible over time.  You eventually must evolve a system for
categorizing and prioritizing new issues based on overall context, not
on an O(N^2) comparison with all the other issues in the database.  It
is normal for the bug database to grow slowly but without bound over
time.  This is not a sign of failure.  In general, guard against the
tendency to draw conclusions from bug statistics (or commit
statistics, for that matter).  They are qualitative events, and cannot
be measured quantitatively.</remark></para>

someone is away from the project for a long time, that doesn't mean
they lose their judgement, so if/when they come back, they'll
presumably know what they don't know, and commit more conservatively
if that's warranted.  Therefore, removing committers for inactivity is
not necessary.  The committers list should stress, however, that the

individual contributions are recognized, and making the project be a
group effort rather than a collection of individual glories (hmmm,
that thought ought perhaps go at the start of this chapter).  One
guideline is: the more ephemeral the forum, the more okay it is to
thank people by name there.  IRC is great, asides in email discussions
are also okay (make sure that the thankee sees it, though!).  On the

<para><remark>(In explaining why there is no definitive answer to the
question of "which fork is the true fork", use the obvious
evolutionary analogy.  Point out how people will colloquially talk of
how fork F came out of project P, rather than the reverse, but this is
in effect a declaration of how that speaker feels about it.  When a
large enough percentage of observers agree, then it starts to become
objectively true.  It is fundamentally a matter of perception: that
is, it's not the case that there's an objective truth here but that we
are only imperfectly able to perceive it.  Rather, the perceptions
<emphasis>are</emphasis> the objective truth, since ultimately a
project (or a fork) is an entity that exists only in people's minds
anyway.)</remark></para>

<para><remark>Paragraph lifted from Chapter 4, may eventually have a
place here:</remark></para>

<para><remark>People tend not to use the threat of a fork as an
extremist debating technique&mdash;"Do things my way or I'll fork the
project!"&mdash;because everyone is aware that a fork which fails to
attract developers away from the original project is unlikely to
survive long.  All observers, not just developers but users and
operating system packagers too, will make their own judgement about
which side to choose.  Anyone who would contemplate initiating a fork
knows this, and would therefore want to appear extremely reluctant to
fork, so that if they finally do it, they can credibly claim it was
the only route left.  Whether they were actually reluctant or not
doesn't matter, since fake reluctance has much the same outward effect
as real reluctance.</remark></para>

<para><remark>(Similar logic underlies one's reaction to a fork: you
may be mad, may feel it was unjust, etc.  But if your goal is to
persuade developers that your side is the safest bet, then you want to
appear as non-vindictive as possible.  In war, it sometimes make
strategic sense to force people to choose sides; in free software, it
does not.)</remark></para>
