<title>Conspicuous Use of Archives</title>

<para><remark>The importance of having all communications be logged
and be searchable, with stable references.  Describe the misery that
results when this is not available -- for example, the pain of the
contactor.se/~dast "route around" that resulted from the lossage of
the native tigris.org mail archiver.  Written guidelines vs precedence
is like the distinction between English statutory law and common law.
Good archiving is essential for the same reason.  It's like an oral
tradition with a video camera constantly running.</remark></para>

<para>Perfect example: a named anchor for *every* FAQ item.</para>

<remark>(Also, get Brian B's story of the FreeBSD IRC archives
here.)</remark>

<sect1 id="pfs-ch-6-sect-5">
<title> Internal vs External Communications </title>

<para> Internal vs external communications.  In free software
projects, there tends to be a smooth continuum between purely internal
discussions and public relations statements.  Discuss how to navigate
this continuum.  Describe how to hook into the standard real-time news
distribution forums (RSS, CIA, etc), and the meta-distribution sites
such as Freshmeat.  </para>
