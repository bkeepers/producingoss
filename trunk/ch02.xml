<sect1 id="pfs-ch-2-sect-1">
<title>Setting Goals, Choosing a License </title>

<para> Setting goals, choosing a license (but refer to Chapter 3 for
the really detailed discussion of licenses.  It's important to *not*
dive into that swamp too early, since the licensing discussion will
probably be the part of the book most often skipped over in a first
reading) </para>

     b) Starting from scratch:
         1) How open should the initial design work be?
         2) Choosing a language; avoiding language holy wars.

Understanding that development will happen differently after the

d) Conflicts of Interest.  In a funded project, the
           corporation or consortium supplying the money may have
           different goals than many of the volunteers have.  How to
           balance the funder's interests with the volunteers'
           interests without either side becoming disgruntled.  [ Case
           studies: Subversion, possibly others ]

these conflicts should be identified and answered early.
Preemptivity is the key.

        g) How to make the project's architecture support division
           among many workers.  (Example: According to Tim [via Andy],
           Linus said that he found it easier to get volunteers
           because he knew how to break down the functionality or
           source code into chunks that different people could
           handle.)  This will tie into material in Chapter 5(a).

<title> Understanding Developers' Motivations </title>

        h) Understanding potential volunteers' motivations will help
           you set things up to attract them.  You can't build the
           lamp until you know what frequencies of light the moths
           are attracted to.  Oh, wait, maybe that's not such a good
           metaphor...
