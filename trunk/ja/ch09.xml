<title>Governments and Open Source</title>

<para>poss2 tbd: mil-oss, Gunnar's timeline, procurement &amp; the
question of where expertise should reside; how to write a contract;
liability; ownership; where to host; use vs creation; be open source
from day one.  Mention ORM, CfA, CivComs.  What other orgs?  Open
source policies, open data policies.</para>

<para>This chapter is mainly about government agencies producing new
open source software and participating in existing open source
projects, though we'll also look a bit at government usage of open
source software.</para>

<para>Since the first edition of this book was published in 2005, I've
done a fair amount of work with various U.S. government
agencies&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;at the federal, state, and municipal
levels&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;on releasing open source software.  I've also
observed, and in a few cases worked with, government agencies outside
the U.S.  These experiences have convinced me of one thing: government
is different.  If you work in a government agency and the material
presented so far in this book has made you shake your head and think
"Sure, but it'll never work here", you don't have to convince
me&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;I already know what you mean.  Governments differ
from individual developers and from private-sector organizations in
some fundamental ways:

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>Governments often don't want to retain technical expertise
  in-house (that's what contractors are for).</listitem>
  <listitem>Governments have rigid and labyrinthine procurement and
  employment policies.  These make it difficult for a government
  agency to be nimbly responsive in an open source development
  community.</listitem>
  <listitem>Government agencies are exquisitely risk-sensitive.
  Somewhere at the top there's an elected official who sees an open
  source project as just one more surface area for opponents to attack
  (when development happens in public, the inevitable false starts and
  wrong turns are also publicly visible, whereas if development had
  taken place behind closed doors, no one would know).</listitem>
  <listitem>Publicity TBD working here.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
