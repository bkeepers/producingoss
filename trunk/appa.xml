<title>Free Version Control Systems</title>

<simplesect>

<para>CVS's shortcomings have inspired many efforts to replace it, and
in the last few years many of these projects have reached usability.
CVS's days as the uncontested default choice are slowly coming to an
end.  Following are all the other open source version control systems
I was aware of as of early 2005.  The only one I use on a regular
basis is Subversion, that's why it's listed first.  I have no
recommendations for or against any of the others; the information here
is taken from their web sites.  See also

<para>Subversion was written first and foremost to be a replacement
for CVS&mdash;that is, to approach version control in roughly the same
way CVS does, but without the problems and feature omissions that most
frequently annoy users of CVS.  One of Subversion's goals is for
people already accustomed to CVS to find the transition to Subversion
relatively smooth.  There is not space here to go into detail about
Subversion's features; see its web site for more information.
<emphasis>[Disclaimer: I am involved in Subversion development, and it
is the only one of these systems that I use on a regular
basis.]</emphasis></para>

<title><emphasis role="bold">SVK</emphasis>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<ulink
        url="http://svk.elixus.org/"/></title>

<para>Although it is built on top of Subversion, SVK probably
resembles Arch more than it does Subversion.  SVK supports distributed
(non-centralized) development, sophisticated change merging, and the
ability to mirror trees from non-SVK version control systems.  See the
web site for details.</para>

<title><emphasis role="bold">Arch</emphasis>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<ulink

<para>GNU Arch supports both distributed and centralized development.
Developers commit their changes to an "archive", which may be local,
and the changes can be pushed and pulled to other archives as the
managers of those archives see fit.  As such a methodology implies,
Arch has more sophisticated merge support than CVS.  Arch also allows
one to easily make branches of archives to which one does not have
commit access.  This is only a brief summary; see the Arch web pages
for details.</para>

<title><emphasis role="bold">monotone</emphasis>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<ulink
        url="http://www.venge.net/monotone/"/></title>

<para>"monotone is a free distributed version control system.  it
provides a simple, single-file transactional version store, with fully
disconnected operation and an efficient peer-to-peer synchronization
protocol.  it understands history-sensitive merging, lightweight
branches, integrated code review and 3rd party testing.  it uses
cryptographic version naming and client-side RSA certificates.  it has
good internationalization support, has no external dependencies, runs
on linux, solaris, OSX, and windows, and is licensed under the GNU
GPL." [sic]</para>

<sect2 id="pfs-vc-codeville">
<title><emphasis role="bold">Codeville</emphasis>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<ulink
        url="http://codeville.org/"/></title>

<para>"Why yet another version control system? All other version
control systems require that you keep careful track of the
relationships between branches so as not have to repeatedly merge the
same conflicts.  Codeville is much more anarchic.  It allows you to
update from or commit to any repository at any time with no
unnecessary re-merges."</para>

<para>"Codeville works by creating an identifier for each change which
is done, and remembering the list of all changes which have been
applied to each file and the last change which modified each line in
each file.  When there's a conflict, it checks to see if one of the
two sides has already been applied to the other one, and if so makes
the other side win automatically.  When there's an actual not
automatically mergeable version conflict, Codeville behaves in almost
exactly the same way as CVS."</para>

<title><emphasis role="bold">Vesta</emphasis>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<ulink
        url="http://www.vestasys.org/"/></title>

<para>"Vesta is a portable SCM [Software Configuration Management]
system targeted at supporting development of software systems of
almost any size, from fairly small (under 10,000 source lines) to very
large (10,000,000 source lines).</para>

<para>Vesta is a mature system.  It is the result of over 10 years of
research and development at the Compaq/Digital Systems Research
Center, and it was in production use by Compaq's Alpha microprocessor
group for over two and a half years.  The Alpha group had over 150
active developers at two sites thousands of miles apart, on the east
and west coasts of the United States.  The group used Vesta to manage
builds with as much as 130 MB of source data, each producing 1.5 GB of
derived data.  The builds done at the eastern site in an average day
produced about 10-15 GB of derived data, all managed by Vesta.
Although Vesta was designed with software development in mind, the
Alpha group demonstrated the system's flexibility by using it for
hardware development, checking their hardware description language
files into Vesta's source code control facility and building
simulators and other derived objects with Vesta's builder.  The
members of the former Alpha group, now a part of Intel, are continuing
to use Vesta today in a new microprocessor project."</para>

<para>"OpenCM is designed as a secure, high-integrity replacement for
CVS.  A list of the key features can be found on the features page.
While not as 'feature rich' as CVS, it supports some useful things
that CVS lacks.  Briefly, OpenCM provides first-class support for
renames and configuration, cryptographic authentication and access
control, and first-class branches."</para>

<para>"PRCS, the Project Revision Control System, is the front end to
a set of tools that (like CVS) provide a way to deal with sets of
files and directories as an entity, preserving coherent versions of
the entire set. ... Its purpose is similar to that of SCCS, RCS, and
CVS, but (according to its authors, at least), it is much simpler than
any of those systems."</para>

<para>"A 'modern' system that uses changesets over file revisions and
distributed operation rather than centralized control.  As long as you
have an e-mail account you can use FastCST.  For larger distribution
you only need an FTP server and/or an HTTP server or use the built in
'serve' command to serve your stuff up directly.  All changesets are
universally unique and have tons of meta-data so you can reject
anything you don't before you try it.  Merging is done by comparing a
merged changeset against the current directory contents, rather than
trying to merge it with another changeset."</para>
