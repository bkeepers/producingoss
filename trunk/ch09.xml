<title>Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents</title>

<simplesect>

<para>The license you select probably won't have a major impact on the
adoption of your project, as long as the license is open source.
Users generally choose software based on quality and features, not on
the details of the license.  Nevertheless, you still need a basic
understanding of free software licensing issues, both to ensure that
the project's license is compatible with its goals, and to be able to
discuss licensing decisions with other people.</para>

<para><remark>(Note to self: find the right place to put an "I am not
a lawyer!"  disclaimer, and put it there!)</remark></para>

<para>The first thing you will notice in any licensing discussion is
that there seem to be many different words for the same
thing: <firstterm>free&nbsp;software</firstterm>,
<firstterm>open&nbsp;source</firstterm>,
<firstterm>FOSS</firstterm>, <firstterm>F/OSS</firstterm>, and
<firstterm>FLOSS</firstterm>.  Let's start by sorting those
out.</para>

</simplesect>

<sect1 id="pfs-licenses-terminology">
<title>Terminology</title>

<para><firstterm>Free software</firstterm> is software that can be
freely shared and modified, including in source code form.  The term
was first coined by Richard Stallman, who codified it in the GNU
General Public License (GPL), and who founded the Free Software
Foundation (<ulink url="http://www.fsf.org/"/>) to promote the
concept.</para>

<para>Although "free software" means pretty much the same thing as
"open source", the FSF, among others, prefers the former term because
it emphasizes the idea of freedom, and the concept of
freely-redistributable software as primarily a social movement rather
than a technical one.  The FSF acknowledges that the term is
ambiguous&mdash;it could mean "free" as in "zero-cost", instead of
"free" as in "freedom"&mdash;but feels that it's still the best term,
all things considered, and that the other possibilities in English
have their own ambiguities.  (Throughout this book "free" is used in
the "freedom" sense, not the "zero-cost" sense.)</para>

<para><firstterm>Open source software</firstterm> is simply free
software under another name, but the different name reflects an
important philosophical difference: "open source" was coined by the
Open Source Initiative (<ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/"/>) as
a deliberate alternative to "free software", in order to make such
software a more palatable choice for corporations, by presenting it as
a development methodology rather than a political movement.  While any
license that is free is also open source, and vice versa (with a few
minor exceptions), people tend to pick one term and stick with it.  In
general, those who prefer "free software" are more likely to have a
philosophical or moral stance on the issue, while those who prefer
"open source" either don't view it as a matter of freedom, or are not
interested in advertising the fact that they do.  See <xref
linkend="pfs-free-vs-open-source"/> for a more detailed history of
this schism.</para>

<para>The Free Software Foundation has an excellent&mdash;utterly
unobjective, but nuanced and quite fair&mdash;exegesis of the two
terms, at
<ulink
url="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-software-for-freedom.html"/>.
The Open Source Initiative's take on it is spread across two pages:
<ulink
url="http://www.opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_hackers.php#marketing"/>
and
<ulink
url="http://www.opensource.org/advocacy/free-notfree.php"/>.</para>

<para>Where there are two of anything, there will soon be three, and
that is exactly what is happening with terms for free software.  The
academic world, perhaps wanting precision and inclusiveness over
elegance, seems to have settled on <firstterm>FOSS</firstterm>, or
sometimes <firstterm>F/OSS</firstterm>, standing for "Free / Open
Source Software".  Another variant gaining momentum is
<firstterm>FLOSS</firstterm>, which stands for "Free / Libre Open
Source Software" ("libre" is familiar across many languages and does
not suffer from ambiguities of "free"; see <ulink
url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOSS"/> for more).</para>

<para>All these terms mean essentially the same thing: software which
can be modified and redistributed by everyone, sometimes&mdash;but not
always&mdash;with the requirement that derivative works be freely
redistributable under the same terms.</para>

<para>There are two widely-used tests for whether a given license is
truly open source (free, libre, etc).  The first is
<firstterm>DFSG-compliance</firstterm>, that is, compliance with the
Debian Free Software Guidelines (<ulink
url="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines"/>).  The Debian
Project's mission is to maintain an entirely free operating system,
such that someone installing it need never doubt that they have the
right to modify and redistribute any or all of the system.  The Debian
Free Software Guidelines are simply the requirements that any software
package's license must meet in order to be included in Debian.
Because the Debian Project spent a good deal of time thinking about
how to construct such a test, the guidelines they came up with have
proven very robust (see <ulink
url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFSG"/>), and as far as I'm aware no
serious objection to them has been raised either by the Free Software
Foundation or the Open Source Initiative.  If you know that a given
license is <firstterm>DFSG-compliant</firstterm>, you know that it
guarantees all the important freedoms (such as forkability even
against the original author's wishes) required to sustain the dynamics
of an open source project.  All of the licenses discussed in this
chapter are DFSG-compliant.</para>

<para>The other widely-used test is approval by the Open Source
Initiative; licenses meeting this test are called
<firstterm>OSI-approved</firstterm>.  The OSI's definition of open
source software is actually based on the Debian Free Software
Guidelines, and any license that meets one definition almost always
meets the other.  There have been a few exceptions over the years, but
only involving niche licenses and not of any relevance here.  Unlike
the Debian Project, the OSI maintains a list of all licenses it has
ever approved, at <ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/"/>,
so that being "OSI-approved" is an unambiguous state: a license either
is or isn't on their list.</para>

<para>The Free Software Foundation also maintains a list of licenses
at <ulink
url="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/license-list.html"/>.  The
FSF categorizes licenses not only by whether they are free, but
whether they are compatible with the GNU General Public License.  GPL
compatibility is an important topic, covered in <ulink
url="pfs-license-compatibility"/>.</para>

<para>A few other terms that come up often in licensing
conversations:</para>

<para><firstterm>Proprietary</firstterm> and
<firstterm>closed-source</firstterm> are the most frequently-used
antonyms for "free" or "open source".  They refer to software
distributed under traditional royalty-based licensing terms, where
users pay per copy.  However, even software which is distributed at no
charge can still be proprietary, if its license does not permit free
redistribution and modification.</para>

<para>Sometimes people use "commercial" as a synonym for
"proprietary", but properly speaking the two are not the same thing.
Free software can be commercial software.  After all, free software
can be sold, as long as the buyers are not restricted from giving away
copies themselves, and it can be commercialized in other ways as well,
for example by selling support, services, and certification.  There
are multi-million dollar companies are built on free software today,
so it is not inherently anti-commercial nor anti-corporate.  On the
other hand, it <emphasis>is</emphasis> anti-proprietary by its nature,
and this is the key way in which it differs from traditional per-copy
licensing.</para>

<para>The other term that gets bandied about a lot is
<firstterm>public domain</firstterm>.  The public domain is a specific
legal state: works in the public domain have no copyright holder,
meaning that there is no one who has the right to restrict copying of
those works.  Being in the public domain is not the same having no
author.  Everything has an author, and even if a work's author or
authors choose to put it in the public domain, that doesn't change the
fact of who wrote it.  It comes down to the difference between
<emphasis>ownership</emphasis>, which is about control over
distribution, and <emphasis>authorship</emphasis>, which is really
about credit and reputation.  There is no necessary legal connection
between the two.  When someone writes a work for hire, for example, in
most jurisdictions whoever paid for the work (usually a corporation)
is the copyright holder by default, even though they are not the
author.  If you look in the front of many books, you will see that
often the publisher owns the copyright, even though the author's name
is on the cover.</para>

<para>When a work is in the public domain, material from it can be
incorporated into a copyrighted work, and thereafter <emphasis>that
copy</emphasis> of the material is covered under the same copyright as
the whole work.  But this does not affect the availability of the
original work, which remains in the public domain.  Thus, releasing
something into the public domain is technically one way to make it
"free", according to the guidelines of most free software certifying
organizations.  However, there are usually good reasons to use a
license instead of just releasing into the public domain: even with
free software certain restrictions can be useful, not only to the
copyright holder but even to recipients as well, as the next section
makes clear.</para>

<!-- ======================== SECTION ============================== -->
<sect1 id="pfs-license-comparison">
<title>License Comparison</title>

<para>Although there are many different free software licenses
available, in the most most important respects they all say the same
things: that anyone can modify the code, that anyone can redistribute
it both in original and modified form, and that the copyright holders
and authors provide no warranties whatsoever (avoiding liability is
especially important given that people might run modified versions
without even knowing it).  The differences between licences boil down
to a few oft-recurring issues:</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry><term>compatibility with proprietary licenses</term>
    <listitem><para>Some free licenses allow the covered code to be
              used in proprietary programs.  This does not affect the
              licensing terms of the proprietary program: it is still
              as proprietary as ever, it just happens to contain some
              code from a non-proprietary source.  The Apache License,
              X Consortium License, BSD-style license, and the
              MIT-style license are all examples of
              proprietary-compatible licenses.</para> 
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>compatibility with other free licenses</term>
    <listitem><para>Most free license are compatible with each other,
              meaning that code under one license can be combined with
              code under another, and the result distributed under
              either license without violating the terms of the
              other.  The major exception to this is the GNU General
              Public License, which requires that any work using GPL'd
              code be itself distributed under the GPL, and without
              adding any further restrictions beyond what the GPL
              requires.  The GPL is compatible with some free
              licenses, but not with others.  This discussed in more
              detail in <xref linkend="pfs-license-compatibility"/>.</para> 
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>enforcement of crediting</term>
    <listitem><para>Some free licenses stipulate that any use of the
              covered code be accompanied by a notice, whose placement
              and display is usually specified, giving credit to the
              authors or copyright holders of the code.  These
              licenses are often still proprietary-compatible: they do
              not necessarily demand that the derivative work be free,
              merely that credit be given to the free code.</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>protection of trademark</term>
    <listitem><para>A variant of credit enforcement,
              trademark-protecting licenses specify that the name of
              the original software (or its copyright holders, or
              their institution, etc) may <emphasis>not</emphasis> be
              used by derivative works without prior written
              permission.  Although credit enforcement insists that a
              certain name be used, and trademark protection insists
              that it not be used, they are both expressions of the
              same desire: that the original code's reputation be
              preserved and transmitted, but not tarnished by
              association.</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>protection of "artistic integrity"</term>
    <listitem><para>Some licenses (the Artistic License, used
              for the most popular implementation of the Perl
              programming language, and Donald Knuth's TeX license,
              for example), requires that modification and
              redistribution be done in a manner that distinguishes
              clearly between the pristine original version of the
              code and any modifications.  They permit essentially the
              same freedoms as other free license, but impose certain
              requirements that make the integrity of the original
              code easy to verify.  These licenses have not caught on
              much beyond the specific programs they were made for,
              and will not be discussed in this chapter; they are
              mentioned here only for completeness' sake.</para> 
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>Most of these stipulations are not mutually exclusive, and some
licenses include several.  The common thread among them is that they
are about what demands the copyright holder places on the recipient,
in order for the recipient to have the right to use and/or
redistribute the code.  For example, some projects want their name and
reputation to be transmitted along with the code, and this is worth
imposing the extra burden of a credit or trademark clause; depending
on its onerousness, that burden may result in some users choosing a
package with a less demanding license.</para>

<!-- ======================== SECTION ============================== -->
<sect2 id="pfs-license-compatibility">
<title>The GPL and License Compatibility</title>

<para>By far the sharpest dividing line in licensing is that between
proprietary-incompatible and proprietary-compatible licenses, that is,
between the GNU GPL and everything else.  The GPL (<ulink
url="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL"/>) is a
<firstterm>copyleft</firstterm>: a license that uses copyright law to
achieve a result opposite to traditional copyright.  Because the
primary goal of the GPL's authors is the promotion of free software,
they deliberately crafted the license to make it impossible to mix
GPL'd code into proprietary programs.  Specifically, among the GPL's
requirements are these two:</para>

<orderedlist>
  <listitem><para>Any derivative work&mdash;that is, any work
            containing a non-trivial amount of GPL'd code&mdash;must
            itself be distributed under the GPL.</para> 
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>No additional restrictions may be placed on the
            redistribution of either the original work or a derivative
            work.  (The exact language is: "You may not impose any
            further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
            rights granted herein.")</para>
  </listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>With these conditions, the GPL succeeds in making freedom
contagious.  Once a program is copyrighted under the GPL, its terms of
redistribution are <firstterm>viral</firstterm>&mdash;they are passed
on to anything else the code gets incorporated into, making it
effectively impossible to use GPL'd code in closed-source programs.
However, these same clauses also make the GPL incompatible with some
other free software licenses.  The usual way this happens is that the
other license imposes a requirement&mdash;for example, a credit clause
requiring the original authors to be mentioned in some way&mdash;that
is incompatible with the GPL's "You may not impose any further
restrictions..." language.  From the point of view of the Free
Software Foundation, these second-order consequences are desirable, or
at least not regrettable.  The GPL not only keeps your software free,
but effectively makes your software an agent in pushing
<emphasis>other</emphasis> software to enforce freedom as well.</para>

<para>The question of whether or not this this is a good way to
promote free software is one of the most persistent holy wars on the
Internet (see <xref linkend="pfs-holy-wars"/>), and we won't
investigate it here.  What's important for our purposes is that
GPL-compatibility is an important issue when choosing a license.  The
GPL is by far the most popular open source license; at <ulink
url="http://freshmeat.net/stats/#license"/>, it is at 68%, and the
next highest license is at 6%.  If you want your code to be able to be
mixed freely with GPL'd code&mdash;and there's a lot of GPL'd code out
there&mdash;then you should pick a GPL-compatible license.  Most of
the GPL-compatible open source licenses are also
proprietary-compatible: that is, code under such a license can be used
in a GPL'd progarm, and it can be used in a proprietary program.  Of
course, the <emphasis>results</emphasis> of these mixings would not be
compatible with each other, since one would be under the GPL and the
other would be under a closed-source license.  But that concern
applies only to the derivative works, not to the code you distribute
in the first place.</para>

<para>Fortunately, the Free Software Foundation maintains a list
showing which licenses are compatible with the GPL and which are not,
at <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html"/>.  All
of the licenses discussed in this chapter are present on that list, on
one side or the other.</para>

<para><remark>(Re dual-licensing: Dual-licensing situations get
started for a number of reasons.  The code may have started out free,
and a permanent proprietary fork may simply not be in the cards (too
much negative publicity, too much momentum in the existing dev
community, whatever).  But also, let's not forget the "Where do you
want to spend your time?" factor.  Sometimes, people start these
companies because they just plain like doing open source development,
and don't want to give it up.  Discuss how all this affects ownership
both legal and psychological.)</remark></para>

it's also good open source public relations.)  Don't go off the deep
end ranting about the coming patent war (or put it in a footnote or an
appendix if you do), but point out that opposition to software patents
is almost universal among open source developers.  Talk about the
