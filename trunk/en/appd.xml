<title>Obsolete Appendix: (was: Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is?)</title>

<simplesect>

<para>This appendix used to contain the complete text of Poul-Henning
Kamp's famous "bikeshed" post, an excerpt from which appears in <xref
linkend="communications"/>).  It is an eloquent disquisition on what
tends to go wrong in group discussions, but to save space I no longer
include it as an appendix in this book.  You can view the entire 
post at <ulink
