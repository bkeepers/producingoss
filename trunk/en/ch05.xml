<title>Money</title>

<simplesect>

<para>This chapter examines how to use money constructively in a free
software environment.  It is aimed not only at developers who are paid
to work on open source projects, but also at their managers (and even
on up to the executives), who need to understand the social dynamics
of the development environment and how money affects them.</para>

<para>Sometimes people are surprised to learn that most free software
is written by paid developers, not by volunteers.  But when you think
about it, it makes sense: a company often needs a particular piece of
software to exist, and to be maintained and developed, and yet does
not need a monopoly on that software.  Lots of companies have web
sites and therefore need a web server; far fewer companies need
exclusive control over the development of their web server, or need to
sell it on a proprietary basis.  The same is true of office software
suites, operating system kernels, network connectivity tools,
educational programs, etc&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;just as historically it
has been true of electric grids, roads, sewer systems, and other goods
that everyone needs but no one needs to own.  Just as we expect road
workers to be paid, we should expect software developers to be paid as
well.</para>

<para>Even in the early days of free software, although the proportion
of truly unpaid volunteers was certainly higher, there were also paid
developers&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and a good deal of informal subsidy as
well, as there continues to be today.  When a system administrator
writes a network analysis tool to help her do her job, then posts it
online and gets bug fixes and feature contributions from other system
administrators, what's happened is that an unofficial consortium has
been formed.  The consortium's funding comes from the sysadmins'
salaries, and its office space and network bandwidth are donated,
albeit unknowingly, by the organizations they work for.  Those
organizations benefitted from the investment, of course, although they
may not be institutionally aware of it at first.</para>

<para>Today these efforts tend to be more formalized.  Corporations
have become conscious of the benefits of open source software, and now
involve themselves directly in its development.  Developers too have
come to expect that really important projects will attract funding in
one way or another.  The question is just how the hierarchical command
structures of corporations and the semi-decentralized, non-coercive
communities of free software projects can work productively with each
other&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and more or less agree on what "productively"
means.</para>

<para>Financial backing is generally welcomed by open source
development communities.  Paid developers mean that bug reports are
more likely to be listened to, that needed work is more likely to get
done, and that the project will be less vulnerable to the Forces of
Chaos (e.g., a key founding developer suddenly losing interest).
After all, credibility is contagious, to a point.  When, for example,
Google backs an open source project, people assume the project will
have the chance to succeed or fail on its merits, with adequate
support in its early stages; their resultant willingness to devote
effort to it can then make this a self-fulfilling prophecy.</para>

<para>However, funding can also bring a perception of control.  If not
handled carefully, money can divide a project into in-group and
out-group developers.  If developers who aren't officially paid to
work on the project get the feeling that design decisions or feature
additions are simply available to the highest bidder, they'll head off
to a project that seems more like a meritocracy and less like unpaid
labor for someone else's benefit.  They may never complain overtly on
the mailing lists.  Instead, there will simply be less and less noise
from external sources, as the volunteers gradually stop trying to be
taken seriously.  The buzz of small-scale activity will continue, in
the form of bug reports and occasional small fixes.  But there won't
be any large code contributions or outside participation in design
discussions.  People sense what's expected of them, and live up (or
down) to those expectations.</para>

<para>Although money needs to be used carefully, that doesn't mean it
can't buy influence.  It most certainly can.  The trick is that it
can't buy influence directly.  In a straightforward commercial
transaction, you trade money for what you want.  If you need a feature
added, you sign a contract, pay for it, and (if all goes well) the
work gets done and the feature eventually lands in the product.  In an
open source project, it's not so simple.  You may sign a contract with
some developers, but they'd be fooling themselves&mdash;and
you&mdash;if they guaranteed that the work you paid for would be
accepted by the development community simply because you paid for it.
The work can only be accepted on its own merits and on how it fits
into the community's vision for the software.  You may have some say
in that vision, but you won't be the only voice.</para>

<para>So money can't purchase influence, but it can purchase things
that <emphasis>lead to</emphasis> influence.  The most obvious example
is programmers.  If you hire good programmers, and they stick around
long enough to get experience with the software and credibility in the
community, then they can influence the project by the same means as
any other member.  They will have a vote, or if there are many of
them, they will have a voting bloc.  If they are respected in the
project, they will have influence beyond just their votes.  There is
no need for paid developers to disguise their motives, either.  After
all, everyone who wants a change made to the software wants it for a
reason.  Your company's reasons are no less legitimate than anyone
else's.  It's just that the weight given to your company's goals will
be determined by its representatives' status in the project, not by
your company's size, budget, or business plan.<footnote><para>When
companies need to guarantee that certain features and bug fixes land
in a specified amount of time, they accomplish this by keeping their
own copy (which may be partially or wholly public) of the project, and
merging it from time to time with a separate public copy that has its
own governance.  Google's Android operating system is a classic
example: Google maintains its own copy of Android, which it governs
pleases, and from time to time merges changes between that copy and
the <ulink
url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Open-source_community"
>Android Open Source Project</ulink>.  Essentially, Google is on a
very long copy-modify-merge loop with respect to the open source
project, or perhaps it's the other way around.  In any case, it is in
neither side's interests to permanently diverge from the
other.</para></footnote></para>

<para>There are many different reasons open source projects get
corporate support.  This list is just a high-level survey.  The items
in it aren't mutually exclusive; often a project's financial backing
will result from several, or even all, of these motivations:</para>

<variablelist>

   <varlistentry><term>Sharing the burden</term>
     <listitem>
     <para>Separate organizations with related software needs often
     find themselves duplicating effort, either by redundantly writing
     similar code in-house, or by purchasing similar products from
     proprietary vendors.  When they realize what's going on, the
     organizations may pool their resources and create (or join) an
     open source project tailored to their needs.  The advantages are
     obvious: the costs of development are divided, but the benefits
     accrue to all.  Although this scenario might seem most intuitive for
     nonprofits, it often makes strategic sense even for for-profit
     competitors.</para></listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry><term>Augmenting services</term>
     <listitem>
     <para>When a company sells services which depend on, or are made
     more attractive by, particular open source programs, it is
     naturally in that company's interests to ensure those programs
     are actively maintained.</para></listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry><term>Creating an ecosystem</term>
     <listitem>
     <para>For investors who like to think big, the right open source
     effort can create a new ecosystem&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;one in which
     those investors are more likely to flourish.  A good example of
     this kind of investment, as of this writing in 2014, is the
     <ulink url="https://www.meteor.com/" >Meteor.com</ulink>
     project.</para>  
     </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry><term>Supporting hardware sales</term>
     <listitem>
     <para>The value of computers and computer components is directly
     related to the amount of software available for them.  Hardware
     vendors&mdash;not just whole-machine vendors, but also makers
     of peripheral devices and microchips&mdash;have found that
     having high-quality free software to run on their hardware is
     important to customers.</para>
     </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry><term>Undermining a competitor</term>
     <listitem>
     <para>Sometimes companies support a particular open source
     project as a means of undermining a competitor's product, which
     may or may not be open source itself.  Eating away at a
     competitor's market share is usually not the sole reason for
     getting involved with an open source project, but it can be a
     factor.</para></listitem>

   <varlistentry><term>Marketing</term>
     <listitem>
     <para>Having your company associated with a popular open source
     application can be simply good brand management.</para>
     </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry><term>Dual-licensing</term>
     <listitem>
     <para><firstterm>Dual-licensing</firstterm> is the practice of
     offering software under a traditional proprietary license for
     customers who want to resell it as part of a proprietary
     application of their own, and simultaneously under a free license
     for those willing to use it under open source terms (see <xref
     linkend="dual-licensing"/><phrase output="printed"> in <xref
     linkend="legal"/></phrase>).  If the open source developer
     community is active, the software gets the benefits of wide-area
     debugging and development, yet the company still gets a royalty
     stream to support some full-time programmers.</para>

     <para>Dual-licensing is controversial because it is not a "pure
     open source play" (as we say in business-speak), but rather yokes
     funding for open source development to a monopoly-based revenue
     stream.  Whether this is a problem for you depends on where you
     fall on the "open source is just a way of software development"
     to "open source is a way of life" spectrum.  The presence of
     revenue from a proprietary version does not necessarily mean that
     the free software version is worse off, and some very well-known
     and widely-used free software has had corresponding proprietary
     versions (<ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL"
     >MySQL</ulink> is probably the most famous example).  However,
     some developers dislike the thought that their contributions may
     end up in the proprietary version.  Also, the mere presence of
     the proprietary version suggests the possibility that some of the
     best salaried developers' attention is going to the proprietary
     code, not the open source code, and this can undermine other
     developers' faith in the open source project.</para>

     <para>None of is meant to persuade you not to do dual-licensing.
     You should just be aware that dual-licensing strategies are
     unlike the other business approaches I've listed here, and that
     it probably requires more care and sophistication to manage
     successfully.</para></listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry><term>Donations</term>
     <listitem>
     <para>A widely-used project can sometimes get significant
     contributions, from both individuals and organizations, just by
     soliciting donations, or by doing an organized crowdfunding
     campaign (e.g., via <ulink url="http://bountysource.com/"
     >Bountysource</ulink>, <ulink url="http://indiegogo.com/"
     >IndieGoGo</ulink>, <ulink url="http://kickstarter.com/"
     >Kickstarter</ulink>, etc)<footnote><para>Aaron Wolf's <ulink
     url="http://snowdrift.coop/" >Snowdrift.coop</ulink> is a recent
     and interesting new approach to crowdfunding for libre projects.
     It focuses on sustainability beyond initial funding, by
     harnessing a limited positive feedback loop: pool donations are
     re-allocated, up to per-donor limits, depending on which projects
     people indicate support for.  It's still in its early stages, so
     it's too early to tell if it will fly, but I thought it deserved
     a footnote.  Check it out; by the time these words are published,
     Snowdrift might be out of alpha.</para></footnote>.  A word of
     caution: if your project accepts donations, do some public
     planning of how the money will be used
     <emphasis>before</emphasis> it comes in.  Discussions about how
     to allocate money tend to go a lot more smoothly when held before
     there's actual money to spend; and anyway, if there are
     significant disagreements, it's better to find that out when the
     money is still theoretical than when it's real.</para></listitem>
   </varlistentry>

</variablelist>

<para>A funder's business model is not the only factor in how that
funder relates to an open source community.  The historical relationship
between the two also matters: did the company start the project, or is
it joining an existing development effort?  In both cases, the funder
will have to earn credibility, but, not surprisingly, there's a bit
more earning to be done in the latter case.  The organization needs to
have clear goals with respect to the project.  Is the company trying
to keep a position of leadership, or simply trying to be one voice in
the community, to guide but not necessarily govern the project's
direction?  Or does it just want to have a couple of committers
around, able to fix customers' bugs and get the changes into the
public distribution without any fuss?</para>

<para>Keep these questions in mind as you read the guidelines that
follow.  They are meant to apply to any sort of organizational
involvement in a free software project, but every project is a human
environment, and therefore no two are exactly alike.  To some degree,
you will always have to play by ear, but following these principles
will increase the likelihood of things turning out the way you
want.</para>

</sect1>

<!-- ======================== subsection ============================== -->
<sect1 id="long-term-developers">
<title>Hire for the Long Term</title>

<para>If you're managing programmers on an open source project, keep
them there long enough that they acquire both technical and political
expertise&mdash;a couple of years, at a minimum.  Of course, no
project, whether open or closed-source, benefits from swapping
programmers in and out too often.  The need for a newcomer to learn
the ropes each time would be a deterrent in any environment.  But the
penalty is even stronger in open source projects, because outgoing
developers take with them not only their knowledge of the code, but
also their status in the community and the human relationships they
have made there.</para>

<para>The credibility a developer has accumulated cannot be
transferred.  To pick the most obvious example, an incoming developer
can't inherit commit access from an outgoing one (see
<xref linkend="money-vs-love"/> later in this chapter), so if the
new developer doesn't already have commit access, he will have to
submit patches until he does.  But commit access is only the most
easily quantifiable manifestation of lost influence.  A long-time developer
also knows all the old arguments that have been hashed and rehashed on
the discussion lists.  A new developer, having no memory of those
conversations, may try to raise the topics again, leading to a loss of
credibility for your organization; the others might wonder "Can't
they remember anything?"  A new developer will also have no political
feel for the project's personalities, and will not be able to
influence development directions as quickly or as smoothly as one
who's been around a long time.</para>

<para>Train newcomers through a program of supervised engagement.  The
new developer should be in direct contact with the public development
community from the very first day, starting off with bug fixes and
cleanup tasks, so he can learn the code base and acquire a reputation
in the community, yet not spark any long and involved design
discussions.  All the while, one or more experienced developers should
be available for questioning, and should be reading every post the
newcomer makes to the development lists, even if they're in threads
that the experienced developers normally wouldn't pay attention to.
This will help the group spot potential rocks before the newcomer runs
aground.  Private, behind-the-scenes encouragement and pointers can
also help a lot, especially if the newcomer is not accustomed to
massively parallel peer review of his code.</para>

<sect2 id="integrating-new-paid-dev">
<title>Case study</title>

<para>At CollabNet, when we hired a new developer to work on
Subversion, we would sit down together and pick some open bugs for the
new person to cut his teeth on.  We'll discuss the technical outlines
of the solutions, and then assign at least one experienced developer
to (publicly) review the patches that the new developer would (also
publicly) post.  We typically didn't even look at the patch before the
main development list saw it, although we could if there were some
reason to.  The important thing is that the new developer go through
the process of public review, learning the code base while
simultaneously becoming accustomed to receiving critiques from
complete strangers.  But we also tried to coordinate the timing so
that our own review came immediately after the posting of the patch.
That way the first review the list sees is ours, which can help set
the tone for the others' reviews.  It also contributes to the idea
that this new person is to be taken seriously: if others see that
we're putting in the time to give detailed reviews, with thorough
explanations and references into the archives where appropriate,
they'll appreciate that a form of training is going on, and that it
probably signifies a long-term investment.  This can make them more
positively disposed toward the developer, to the degree of spending a
little extra time answering questions and reviewing patches
themselves.</para>
</sect2>

</sect1>

<!-- ======================== subsection ============================== -->
<sect1 id="appear-as-many">
<title>Appear as Many, Not as One</title>

<para>Your developers should strive to appear in the project's public
forums as individual participants, rather than as a monolithic
corporate presence.  This is not because there is some negative
connotation inherent in monolithic corporate presences (well, perhaps
there is, but that's not what this book is about).  Rather, it's
because individuals are the only sort of entity open source projects
are structurally equipped to deal with.  An individual contributor can
have discussions, submit patches, acquire credibility, vote, and so
forth.  A company cannot.</para>

<para>Furthermore, by behaving in a decentralized manner, you avoid
stimulating centralization of opposition.  Let your developers
disagree with each other on the mailing lists.  Encourage them to
review each other's code as often, and as publicly, as they would
anyone else's.  Discourage them from always voting as a bloc, because
if they do, others may start to feel that, just on general principles,
there should be an organized effort to keep them in check.</para>

<para>There's a difference between actually being decentralized and
simply striving to appear that way.  Under certain circumstances,
having your developers behave in concert can be quite useful, and they
should be prepared to coordinate behind the scenes when necessary.
For example, when making a proposal, having several people chime in
with agreement early on can help it along, by giving the impression of
a growing consensus.  Others will feel that the proposal has momentum,
and that if they were to object, they'd be stopping that momentum.
Thus, people will object only if they have a good reason to do so.
There's nothing wrong with orchestrating agreement like this, as long
as objections are still taken seriously.  The public manifestations of
a private agreement are no less sincere for having been coordinated
beforehand, and are not harmful as long as they are not used to
prejudicially snuff out opposing arguments.  Their purpose is merely
to inhibit the sort of people who like to object just to stay in
shape; see <xref linkend="bikeshed"/><phrase output="printed">
in <xref linkend="communications"/></phrase> for more about
them.</para>

</sect1>

<!-- ======================== subsection ============================== -->
<sect1 id="open-motives">
<title>Be Open About Your Motivations</title>

<para>Be as open about your organization's goals as you can without
compromising business secrets.  If you want the project to acquire a
certain feature because, say, your customers have been clamoring for
it, just say so outright on the mailing lists.  If the customers wish
to remain anonymous, as is sometimes the case, then at least ask them
if they can be used as unnamed examples.  The more the public
development community knows about <emphasis>why</emphasis> you want
what you want, the more comfortable they'll be with whatever you're
proposing.</para>

<para>This runs counter to the instinct&mdash;so easy to acquire, so
hard to shake off&mdash;that knowledge is power, and that the more
others know about your goals, the more control they have over you.
But that instinct would be wrong here.  By publicly advocating the
feature (or bugfix, or whatever it is), you have
<emphasis>already</emphasis> laid your cards on the table.  The only
question now is whether you will succeed in guiding the community to
share your goal.  If you merely state that you want it, but can't
provide concrete examples of why, your argument is weak, and people
will start to suspect a hidden agenda.  But if you give just a few
real-world scenarios showing why the proposed feature is important,
that can have a dramatic effect on the debate.</para>

<para>To see why this is so, consider the alternative.  Too
frequently, debates about new features or new directions are long and
tiresome.  The arguments people advance often reduce to "I personally
want X," or the ever-popular "In my years of experience as a software
designer, X is extremely important to users" or "...is a useless frill
that will please no one."  Predictably, the absence of real-world usage
data neither shortens nor tempers such debates, but instead allows
them to drift farther and farther from any mooring in actual user
experience.  Without some countervailing force, the end result is
likely to be determined by whoever was the most articulate, or
the most persistent, or the most senior.</para>

<para>As an organization with plentiful customer data available, you
have the opportunity to provide just such a countervailing force.  You
can be a conduit for information that might otherwise have no means of
reaching the development community.  The fact that the information
supports your desires is nothing to be embarrassed about.  Most
developers don't individually have very broad experience with how the
software they write is used.  Each developer uses the software in
her own idiosyncratic way; as far as other usage patterns go, she's
relying on intuition and guesswork, and deep down, she knows
this.  By providing credible data about a significant number of users,
you are giving the public development community something akin to
oxygen.  As long as you present it right, they will welcome it
enthusiastically, and it will propel things in the direction you want
to go.</para>

<para>The key, of course, is presenting it right.  It will never do to
insist that simply because you deal with a large number of users, and
because they need (or think they need) a given feature, therefore
your solution ought to be implemented.  Instead, you should focus your
initial posts on the problem, rather than on one particular solution.
Describe in great detail the experiences your customers are
encountering, offer as much analysis as you have available, and as
many reasonable solutions as you can think of.  When people start
speculating about the effectiveness of various solutions, you can
continue to draw on your data to support or refute what they say.  You
may have one particular solution in mind all along, but don't single
it out for special consideration at first.  This is not deception, it
is simply standard "honest broker" behavior.  After all, your true
goal is to solve the problem; a solution is merely a means to that
end.  If the solution you prefer really is superior, other developers
will recognize that on their own eventually&mdash;and then they will
get behind it of their own free will, which is much better than you
browbeating them into implementing it.  (There is also the possibility
that they will think of a better solution.)</para>

<para>This is not to say that you can't ever come out in favor of a
specific solution.  But you must have the patience to see the analysis
you've already done internally repeated on the public development
lists.  Don't post saying "Yes, we've been over all that here, but it
doesn't work for reasons A, B, and C.  When you get right down to it,
the only way to solve this is Q."  The problem is not so much that it
sounds arrogant as that it gives the impression that you have
<emphasis>already</emphasis> devoted some unknown (but, people will
presume, large) amount of analytical resources to the problem, behind
closed doors.  It makes it seem as though efforts have been going on,
and perhaps decisions made, that the public is not privy to&mdash;and
that is a recipe for resentment.</para>

<para>Naturally, <emphasis>you</emphasis> know how much effort you've
devoted to the problem internally, and that knowledge is, in a way, a
disadvantage.  It puts your developers in a slightly different mental
space than everyone else on the mailing lists, reducing their ability
to see things from the point of view of those who haven't yet thought
about the problem as much.  The earlier you can get everyone else
thinking about things in the same terms as you do, the smaller this
distancing effect will be.  This logic applies not only to individual
technical situations, but to the broader mandate of making your goals
as clear as you can.  The unknown is always more destabilizing than
the known.  If people understand why you want what you want, they'll
feel comfortable talking to you even when they disagree.  If they
can't figure out what makes you tick, they'll assume the worst, at
least some of the time.</para>

<para>You won't be able to publicize everything, of course, and people
won't expect you to.  All organizations have secrets; perhaps
for-profits have more of them, but nonprofits have them too.  If you
must advocate a certain course, but can't reveal anything about why,
then simply offer the best arguments you can under that handicap, and
accept the fact that you may not have as much influence as you want in
the discussion.  This is one of the compromises you make in order to
have a development community not on your payroll.</para>

<title>Money Can't Buy You Love</title>

<para>If you're a paid developer on a project, then set guidelines
early on about what the money can and cannot buy.  This does not mean
you need to post twice a day to the mailing lists reiterating your
noble and incorruptible nature.  It merely means that you should be on
the lookout for opportunities to defuse the tensions that
<emphasis>could</emphasis> be created by money.  You don't need to
start out assuming that the tensions are there; you do need to
demonstrate an awareness that they have the potential to arise.</para>

<para>A perfect example of this came up early in the Subversion project.
Subversion was started in 2000 by <ulink
url="http://www.collab.net/">CollabNet</ulink>, which has been the
project's primary funder since its inception, paying the salaries of
several developers (disclaimer: I'm one of them).  Soon after the
project began, we hired another developer, Mike Pilato, to join the
effort.  By then, coding had already started.  Although Subversion was
still very much in the early stages, it already had a development
community with a set of basic ground rules.</para>

<para>Mike's arrival raised an interesting question.  Subversion
already had a policy about how a new developer gets commit access.
First, he submits some patches to the development mailing list.  After
enough patches have gone by for the other committers to see that the
new contributor knows what he's doing, someone proposes that he just
commit directly (that proposal is private, as described in <xref
linkend="committers"/>).  Assuming the committers agree, one of
them mails the new developer and offers him direct commit access to
the project's repository.</para>

<para>CollabNet had hired Mike specifically to work on Subversion.
Among those who already knew him, there was no doubt about his coding
skills or his readiness to work on the project.  Furthermore, the
volunteer developers had a very good relationship with the CollabNet
employees, and most likely would not have objected if we'd just given
Mike commit access the day he was hired.  But we knew we'd be setting
a precedent.  If we granted Mike commit access by fiat, we'd be saying
that CollabNet had the right to ignore project guidelines, simply
because it was the primary funder.  While the damage from this would
not necessarily be immediately apparent, it would gradually result in
the non-salaried developers feeling disenfranchised.  Other people
have to earn their commit access&mdash;CollabNet just buys
it.</para>

<para>So Mike agreed to start out his employment at CollabNet like any
other volunteer developer, without commit access.  He sent patches to
the public mailing list, where they could be, and were, reviewed by
everyone.  We also said on the list that we were doing things this way
deliberately, so there could be no missing the point.  After a couple
of weeks of solid activity by Mike, someone (I can't remember if it
was a CollabNet developer or not) proposed him for commit access, and
he was accepted, as we knew he would be.</para>

<para>That kind of consistency gets you a credibility that money could
never buy.  And credibility is a valuable currency to have in
technical discussions: it's immunization against having one's motives
questioned later.  In the heat of argument, people will sometimes look
for non-technical ways to win the battle.  The project's primary
funder, because of its deep involvement and obvious concern over the
directions the project takes, presents a wider target than most.  By
being scrupulous to observe all project guidelines right from the
start, the funder makes itself the same size as everyone else.</para>

<para>The need for the funders to play by the same rules as everyone

harder to pull
off in the presence of funding, particularly if the dictator works for
the primary funder.  Since a dictatorship has few rules, it is hard
for the funder to prove that it's abiding by community standards, even
when it is.  It's certainly not impossible; it just requires a project
leader who is able to see things from the point of view of the outside
developers, as well as that of the funder, and act accordingly.  Even
then, it's probably a good idea to have a proposal for non-dictatorial
governance sitting in your back pocket, ready to be brought out the

<!-- ======================== subsection ============================== -->
<sect1 id="contracting">
<title>Contracting</title>

<para>Contracted work needs to be handled carefully in free software
projects.  Ideally, if you hire a contractor you want her work to be
accepted by the community and folded into the public distribution.  In
theory, it wouldn't matter who the contractor is, as long as her work
is good and meets the project's guidelines.  Theory and practice can
sometimes match, too: a complete stranger who shows up with a good
patch <emphasis>will</emphasis> generally be able to get it into the
software.  The trouble is, it's very hard to produce an acceptable
patch for a non-trivial enhancement or new feature while truly being a
complete stranger; one must first discuss it with the rest of the
project.  The duration of that discussion cannot be precisely
predicted.  If the contractor is paid by the hour, you may end up
paying more than you expected; if she is paid a flat sum, she may end
up doing more work than she can afford.</para>

<para>There are two ways around this.  The preferred way is to make an
educated guess about the length of the discussion process, based on
past experience, add in some padding for error, and base the contract
on that.  It also helps to divide the problem into as many small,
independent chunks as possible, to increase the predictability of each
chunk.  The other way is to contract solely for delivery of a patch,
and treat the patch's acceptance into the public project as a separate
matter.  Then it becomes much easier to write the contract, but you're
stuck with the burden of maintaining a private patch for either as
long as you depend on the software or for as long as it takes you to
get that patch into the upstream codebase.</para>

<para>Even with the preferred way, the contract itself cannot require
that the patch be accepted by the upstream project, because that would
involve selling something that's not for sale.  (What if the rest of
the project unexpectedly decides not to support the feature?)
However, the contract can require a <foreignphrase>bona
fide</foreignphrase> effort to get the change accepted by the
community, and that it be committed to the repository if the community
agrees with it.  For example, if the project has written standards
(e.g., about coding conventions, documentation, writing regression
tests, submitting patches, etc), the contract can reference those
standards and specify that the contracted work must meet them.  In
practice, this usually works out the way everyone hopes.</para>

<para>The best tactic for successful contracting is to hire one of the
project's developers&mdash;preferably a committer&mdash;as the
contractor.  This may seem like a form of purchasing influence, and,
well, it is.  But it's not as corrupt as it might seem.  A developer's
influence in the project is due mainly to the quality of her code and
to her interactions with other developers.  The fact that she has a
contract to get certain things done doesn't raise her status in any
way, and doesn't lower it either, though it may make people scrutinize
her more carefully.  Most developers would not risk their long-term
position in the project by backing an inappropriate or widely disliked
new feature.  In fact, part of what you get, or should get, when you
hire such a contractor is advice about what sorts of changes are
likely to be accepted by the community.  You also get a slight shift
in the project's priorities.  Because prioritization is just a matter
of who has time to work on what, when you pay for someone's time, you
cause their work to move up in the priority queue a bit.  This is a
well-understood fact of life among experienced open source developers,
and at least some of them will devote attention to the contractor's
work simply because it looks like it's going to <emphasis>get
done</emphasis>, so they want to help it get done right.  Perhaps they
won't write any of the code, but they'll still discuss the design and
review the code, both of which can be very useful.  For all these
reasons, the contractor is best drawn from the ranks of those already
involved with the project.</para>

<para>This immediately raises two questions: Should contracts ever be
private?  And when they're not, should you worry about creating
tensions in the community by the fact that you've contracted with some
developers and not others?</para>

<para>It's best to be open about contracts when you can.  Otherwise,
the contractor's behavior may seem strange to others in the
community&mdash;perhaps she's suddenly giving inexplicably high
priority to features she's never shown interest in the past.  When
people ask her why she wants them now, how can she answer convincingly
if she can't talk about the fact that she's been contracted to write
them?</para>

<para>At the same time, neither you nor the contractor should act as
though others should treat your arrangement as a big deal.  Too often
I've seen contractors waltz onto a development list with the attitude
that their posts should be taken more seriously simply because they're
being paid.  That kind of attitude signals to the rest of the project
that the contractor regards the fact of the contract&mdash;as opposed
to the code <emphasis>resulting</emphasis> from the contract&mdash;to
be the important thing.  But from the other developers' point of view,
only the code matters.  At all times, the focus of attention should be
kept on technical issues, not on the details of who is paying whom.
For example, one of the developers in the Subversion community handles
contracting in a particularly graceful way.  While discussing his code
changes in IRC, he'll mention as an aside (often in a private remark,
an IRC <firstterm>privmsg</firstterm>, to one of the other committers)
that he's being paid for his work on this particular bug or feature.
But he also consistently gives the impression that he'd want to be
working on that change anyway, and that he's happy the money is making
it possible for him to do that.  He may or may not reveal his
customer's identity, but in any case he doesn't dwell on the contract.
His remarks about it are just an ornament to an otherwise technical
discussion about how to get something done.</para>

<para>That example shows another reason why it's good to be open about
contracts.  There may be multiple organizations sponsoring contracts
on a given open source project, and if each knows what the others are
trying to do, they may be able to pool their resources.  In the above
case, the project's largest funder (CollabNet) was not involved with
these piecework contracts, but knowing that someone else was
sponsoring certain bug fixes allowed CollabNet to redirect its
resources to other bugs, resulting in greater efficiency for the
project as a whole.</para>

<para>Will other developers resent that some are paid for working on
the project?  In general, no, particularly when those who are paid are
established, well-respected members of the community anyway.  No one
expects contract work to be distributed equally among all the
committers.  People understand the importance of long-term
relationships: the uncertainties involved in contracting are such that
once you find someone you can work reliably with, you would be
reluctant to switch to a different person just for the sake of
evenhandedness.  Think of it this way: the first time you hire, there
will be no complaints, because clearly you had to pick
<emphasis>someone</emphasis>&mdash;it's not your fault you can't hire
everyone.  Later, when you hire the same person a second time, that's
just common sense: you already know her, the last time was
successful, so why take unnecessary risks?  Thus, it's perfectly
natural to have a few go-to people in the community, instead of
spreading the work around evenly.</para>

<sect2 id="community-review-acceptance">
<title>Review and Acceptance of Changes</title>

<para>The project's community will always be important to the
long-term success of contract work.  Their involvement in the design
and review process for sizeable changes cannot be an afterthought; It
must be considered part of the work, and fully embraced by the
contractor.  Don't think of community scrutiny as an obstacle to be
overcome&mdash;think of it as a free design board and QA department.
It is a benefit to be aggressively pursued, not merely endured.</para>

<title>Case study: the CVS password-authentication protocol</title>

<para>In 1995, I was one half of a partnership that provided support
and enhancements for CVS (the Concurrent Versions System; see <ulink
url="http://nongnu.org/cvs" >nongnu.org/cvs</ulink>).  My partner Jim
Blandy and I were, informally, the maintainers of CVS by that point.  But
we'd never thought carefully about how we ought to relate to the
existing mostly part-time and volunteer CVS development community.  We
just assumed that they'd send in patches, and we'd apply them, and
that was pretty much how it worked.</para>

<para>Back then, networked CVS could be done only over a remote login
program such as <literal>rsh</literal>.  Using the same password for
CVS access as for login access was an obvious security risk, and many
organizations were put off by it.  A major investment bank hired us to
add a new authentication mechanism, so they could safely use networked
CVS with their remote offices.</para>

<para>Jim and I took the contract and sat down to design the new
authentication system.  What we came up with was pretty simple (the
United States had export controls on cryptographic code at the time,
so the customer understood that we couldn't implement strong
authentication), but as we were not experienced in designing such
protocols, we still made a few gaffes that would have been obvious to
an expert.  These mistakes would easily have been caught had we taken
the time to write up a proposal and run it by the other developers for
review.  But we never did so, because it didn't occur to us to think
of the development list as a resource to be used to improve our
contracted work.  We knew that people
were probably going to accept whatever we committed, and&mdash;because
we didn't know what we didn't know&mdash;we didn't bother to do the
work in a visible way, e.g., posting patches frequently, making small,
easily digestible commits to a special branch, etc.  The resulting
authentication protocol was not very good, and of course, once it
became established, it was difficult to improve, because of
compatibility concerns.</para>

<para>The root of the problem was not lack of experience; we could
easily have learned what we needed to know.  The problem was our
attitude toward the volunteer development community.  We regarded
acceptance of the changes as a hurdle to leap, rather than as a
process by which the quality of the changes could be improved.  Since
we were confident that almost anything we did would be accepted (as it
was), we made little effort to get others involved.</para>

<para>Obviously, when you're choosing a contractor, you want someone
with the right technical skills and experience for the job.  But it's
also important to choose someone with a track record of constructive
interaction with the other developers in the community.  That way

<sect1 id="funding-non-programming">
<title>Funding Non-Programming Activities</title>

<para>Programming is only part of the work that goes on in an open
source project.  From the point of view of the project's volunteers,
it's the most visible and glamorous part.  This unfortunately means
that other activities, such as documentation, formal testing, etc., can
sometimes be neglected, at least compared to the amount of attention
they often receive in proprietary software.  Corporate organizations
are sometimes able to make up for this, by devoting some of their
internal software development infrastructure to open source
projects.</para>

<para>The key to doing this successfully is to translate between the
company's internal processes and those of the public development
community.  Such translation is not effortless: often the two are not
a close match, and the differences can only be bridged via human
intervention.  For example, the company may use a different bug
tracker than the public project.  Even if they use the same tracking
software, the data stored in it will be very different, because the
bug-tracking needs of a company are very different from those of a
free software community.  A piece of information that starts in one
tracker may need to be reflected in the other, with confidential
portions removed or, in the other direction, added.</para>

<para>The sections that follow are about how to build and maintain
such bridges.  The end result should be that the open source project
runs more smoothly, the community recognizes the company's investment
of resources, and yet does not feel that the company is
inappropriately steering things toward its own goals.</para>

     have salaried developers, for example, use them as a liason.

     them fact-checked and also *politics*-checked first.  Make sure

     devoted to the project. -->

<title>Quality Assurance (i.e., Professional Testing)</title>

<para>In proprietary software development, it is normal to have teams
of people dedicated solely to quality assurance: bug hunting,
performance and scalability testing, interface and documentation
checking, etc.  As a rule, these activities are not pursued as
vigorously by the volunteer community on a free software project.
This is partly because it's hard to get volunteer labor for
unglamorous work like testing, partly because people tend to assume
that having a large user community gives the project good testing
coverage, and, in the case of performance and scalability testing,
partly because volunteers often don't have access to the necessary
hardware resources anyway.</para>

<para>The assumption that having many users is equivalent to having
many testers is not entirely baseless.  Certainly there's little point
assigning testers for basic functionality in common environments: bugs
there will quickly be found by users in the natural course of things.
But because users are just trying to get work done, they do not
consciously set out to explore uncharted edge cases in the program's
functionality, and are likely to leave certain classes of bugs
unfound.  Furthermore, when they discover a bug with an easy
workaround, they often silently implement the workaround without
bothering to report the bug.  Most insidiously, the usage patterns of
your customers (the people who drive <emphasis>your</emphasis>
interest in the software) may differ in statistically significant ways
from the usage patterns of the Average User In The Street.</para>

<para>A professional testing team can uncover these sorts of bugs, and
can do so as easily with free software as with proprietary software.
The challenge is to convey the testing team's results back to the
public in a useful form.  In-house testing departments usually have
their own way of reporting test results to their own developers,
involving company-specific
jargon, or specialized knowledge about particular customers and their
data sets.  Such reports would be inappropriate for the public bug
tracker, both because of their form and because of confidentiality
concerns.  Even if your company's internal bug tracking software
were the same as that used by the public project, management might
need to make company-specific comments and metadata changes to the
tickets (for example, to raise an ticket's internal priority, or
schedule its resolution for a particular customer).  Usually such
notes are confidential&mdash;sometimes they're not even shown to the
customer.  But even when they're not confidential, they're not very
helpful to the public project.</para>

<para>Yet the core bug report itself <emphasis>is</emphasis> important
to the public.  In fact, a bug report from your testing department is
in some ways more valuable than one received from users at large,
since the testing department probes for things that other users won't.
Given that you're unlikely to get that particular bug report from any
other source, you definitely want to preserve it and make it
available to the public project.</para>

<para>To do this, either the QA department can file tickets directly in
the public ticket tracker, if they're comfortable with that, or an
intermediary (usually one of the developers) can "translate" the
testing department's internal reports into new tickets in the public
tracker.  Translation simply means describing the bug in a way that
makes no reference to customer-specific information (the reproduction
recipe may use customer data, assuming the customer approves it, of
course).</para>

<para>It is definitely preferable to have the QA department filing
tickets in the public tracker directly.  That gives the public a more
direct appreciation of your company's involvement with the project:
useful bug reports add to your organization's credibility just as any
technical contribution would.  It also gives developers a direct line
of communication to the testing team.  For example, if the internal QA
team is monitoring the public ticket tracker, a developer can commit a
fix for a scalability bug (which the developer may not have the
resources to test herself), and then add a note to the ticket asking
the QA team to see if the fix had the desired effect.  Expect a bit of
resistance from some of the developers; programmers have a tendency to
regard QA as, at best, a necessary evil.  The QA team can easily
overcome this by finding significant bugs and filing comprehensible
reports; on the other hand, if their reports are not at least as good
as those coming from the regular user community, then there's no point
having them interact directly with the development team.</para>

<para>Either way, once a public ticket exists, the original internal
ticket should simply reference the public ticket for technical content.
Management and paid developers may continue to annotate the internal
ticket with company-specific comments as necessary, but use the public
ticket for information that should be available to everyone.</para>

<para>You should go into this process expecting extra overhead.
Maintaining two tickets for one bug is, naturally, more work than
maintaining one ticket.  The benefit is that many more coders will see
the report and be able to contribute to a solution.</para>

<title>Legal Advice and Protection</title>

<para>Corporations, for-profit or nonprofit, are almost the only
entities that ever pay attention to complex legal issues in free
software.  Individual developers often understand the nuances of
various open source licenses, but they generally do not have the time
or resources to competently handle legal issues themselves.  If your
company has a legal department, it can help a project by assisting
with trademark issues, copyright license ownership and compatibility
questions, defense against patent trolls, etc.  If the project decides
to organize formally, or to join an existing umbrella organization,
your legal department can help with issues of corporate law, asset
transfer, reviewing agreements, and other due diligence
matters.</para>

<para>Some more concrete ideas of what sorts of legal help might be
useful are discussed in <xref linkend="legal"/>.  The main thing is to
make sure that communications between the legal department and the
development community, if they happen at all, happen with a mutual
appreciation of the very different universes the parties are coming
from.  On occasion, these two groups talk past each other, each side
assuming domain-specific knowledge that the other does not have.  A
good strategy is to have a liaison (usually a developer, or else a
lawyer with technical expertise) stand in the middle and translate for
as long as needed.</para>

<title>Documentation and Usability</title>

<para>Documentation and usability are both famous weak spots in open
source projects, although I think, at least in the case of
documentation, that the difference between free and proprietary
software is frequently exaggerated.  Nevertheless, it is empirically
true that much open source software lacks first-class documentation
and usability research.</para>

<para>If your organization wants to help fill these gaps for a
project, probably the best thing it can do is hire people who
are <emphasis>not</emphasis> regular developers on the project, but
who will be able to interact productively with the developers.
Not hiring regular developers is good for two reasons: one, that way
you don't take development time away from the project; two, those
closest to the software are usually the wrong people to write
documentation or investigate usability anyway, because they have
trouble seeing the software from an outsider's point of view.</para>

<para>However, it will still be necessary for whoever works on these
problems to communicate with the developers.  Find people who are
technical enough to talk to the coding team, but not so expert in the
software that they can't empathize with regular users anymore.</para>

<para>A medium-level user is probably the right person to write good
documentation.  In fact, after the first edition of this book was
published, I received the following email from an open source
developer named Dirk Reiners:</para>

<blockquote>
<para>One comment on Money::Documentation and Usability: when we had some 
money to spend and decided that a beginner's tutorial was the most 
critical piece that we needed we hired a medium-level user to write it. 
He had gone through the induction to the system recently enough to 
remember the problems, but he had gotten past them so he knew how to 
describe them. That allowed him to write something that needed only 
minor fixes by the core developers for the things that he hadn't gotten 
right, but still covering the 'obvious' stuff devs would have missed.</para>

<para>His case was even better, as it had been his job to introduce a bunch of 
other people (students) to the system, so he combined the experience of 
many people, which is something that was just a lucky occurrence and is 
probably hard to get in most cases.</para>

<title>Funding User Experience (UX) Work</title>

<para>The field of user experience (<firstterm>UX</firstterm>) design
has lately (as of this writing in early 2014) begun to acquire a new
seriousness of purpose and consistency of professional standards.
Naturally, one thing many companies think of when they want to help
improve an open source project is to fund UX work, since that's just
the sort of thing that projects often overlook or, in some cases,
don't even know they need.</para>

<para>As with many other types of engagement, do not assume that a UX
expert can be parachuted into the project.  User experience design is
not a checkbox.  It is an attitude taken by a team throughout
development, and one of the primary qualifications to look for in UX
contractors is their ability to gain long-term credibility with the
developers, and to help developers pay attention to user experience
goals.  For example, in addition to their innate domain knowledge, UX
designers often know how to set up and incorporate feedback from user
trials&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;but those trials will only be effective if
the results are presented to the development team in a way that makes
it easy for the developers to take the results seriously.  This can
only happen through a sustained, two-way interaction, in which UX
experts are subscribed to the appropriate project forums and take the
attitude that they are a kind of specialized developer on the project,
rather than an outside expert providing advice.  Use UX experts who
have worked with open source projects before, if possible.</para>

<title>Providing Hosting/Bandwidth</title>

<para>The inexorable rise of zero-cost canned hosting sites (see <xref
linkend="canned-hosting" /><phrase output="printed"> in <xref
linkend="technical-infrastructure"/></phrase>) for open source
projects has meant that it is increasingly unnecessary for projects to
get corporate support for basic project-hosting infrastructure.  It
still happens sometimes, usually in cases where the company itself
started the project, and is trying to create or keep an association in
the public's mind between the project and the company.  The most
common technique for creating this association is for the company to
host the project's resources under the company's domain name, thus
getting association through the project's URLs.</para>

<para>While this will cause most users to think of the software as
having <emphasis>something</emphasis> to do with your company, it can
also cause a problem: developers are aware of this associative
tendency too, and may not be very comfortable with having the project
hosted under your domain unless you're seriously contributing to the
project&mdash;not just bandwidth and server space, but significant
amounts of development time.  After all, there are a lot of free
places to host these days.  The community may eventually feel that the
implied misallocation of credit is not worth the minor convenience
brought by donated hosting, and may even attempt to take the project
elsewhere.  So if you want to provide hosting, do so&mdash;but if you
are actually trying to create a public association between your
company and the project, make sure that the level of support you
provide is matched to the amount of credit you claim, whether you
claim it via URL, banner ads, or some other means.</para>

<title>Providing Build Farms and Development Servers</title>

<para>Many projects have infrastructure needs beyond just hosting of
code, bug tracker, etc.  For example, projects often use
<firstterm>continuous integration</firstterm> (CI) testing
(a.k.a. <firstterm>build farms</firstterm>) to automatically ensure
that the changes developers are committing both integrate into the
mainline trunk and pass all regression tests<footnote><para>The
Wikipedia page <ulink
url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration"
>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration</ulink> has a good
description of this practice and its variants.</para></footnote>.
However, depending on the size and complexity of the codebase, the
number of developers checking in changes, and other factors, running a
responsive build farm can cost more money than any individual
developer has at their disposal.  A good way to help, and gain some
goodwill in the process, is to donate the server space and bandwith
<emphasis>and</emphasis> the technical expertise to set up the
continuous integration and automated testing.  If you don't have the
technical expertise available on staff, you could hire someone from
the project to do it, or at the very least give some of the project's
developers administrative access to the CI servers so they can set
things up themselves.</para>

<title>Marketing</title>

<para>Although most open source developers would probably hate to
admit it, marketing works.  Good marketing <emphasis>can</emphasis>
create buzz around an open source product, even to the point where
hardheaded coders find themselves having vaguely positive thoughts
about the software for reasons they can't quite put their finger on.
It is not my purpose here to dissect the arms-race dynamics of marketing
in general.  Any corporation involved in free software will eventually
find itself considering how to market themselves, the software, or
their relationship to the software.  The advice below is about how to
avoid common pitfalls in such an effort; see also <xref
linkend="publicity"/><phrase output="printed"> in <xref
linkend="communications"/></phrase>.</para>

<!-- ======================== subsection ============================== -->
<sect2 id="goldfish-bowl">
<title>Remember That You Are Being Watched</title>

<para>For the sake of keeping the volunteer developer community on
your side, it is <emphasis>very</emphasis> important not to say
anything that isn't demonstrably true.  Audit all claims carefully
before making them, and give the public the means to check your claims
on their own.  Independent fact checking is a major part of open
source, and it applies to more than just the code.</para>

<para>Naturally no one would advise companies to make unverifiable
claims anyway.  But with open source activities, there is an unusually
high quantity of people with the expertise to verify
claims&mdash;people who are also likely to have high-bandwidth
Internet access and the right social contacts to publicize their
findings in a damaging way, should they choose to.  When Global
Megacorp Chemical Industries pollutes a stream, that's verifiable, but
only by trained scientists, who can then be refuted by Global
Megacorp's scientists, leaving the public scratching their heads and
wondering what to think.  On the other hand, your behavior in the open
source world is not only visible and recorded, it is also easy for
many people to check it independently, come to their own conclusions,
and spread those conclusions by word of mouth.  These communications
networks are already in place; they are the essence of how open source
operates, and they can be used to transmit any sort of information.
Refutation is usually difficult, if not impossible&mdash;especially
when what people are saying is true.</para>

<para>For example, it's okay to refer to your organization as having
"founded project X" if you really did.  But don't refer to yourself as
the "makers of X" if most of the code was written by outsiders.
Conversely, don't claim to have a deeply involved volunteer developer
community if anyone can look at your repository and see that there are
few or no code changes coming from outside your organization.</para>

<sect3 id="activity-cannot-be-faked">
<title>Case study: You can't fake activity, so don't try</title>

<para>Once I saw an announcement by a very well-known computer
company, stating that they were releasing an important software
package under an open source license.  When the initial announcement
came out, I took a look at their now-public version control repository
and saw that it contained only three revisions.  In other words, they
had done an initial import of the source code, but hardly anything had
happened since then.  That in itself was not worrying&mdash;they'd
just made the announcement, after all.  There was no reason to expect
a lot of development activity right away.</para>

<para>Some time later, they made another announcement.  Here is what
it said, with the name and release number replaced by pseudonyms:</para>

  <blockquote>
    <para><emphasis>We are pleased to announce that following
    rigorous testing by the Singer Community, Singer&nbsp;5 for Linux
    and Windows are now ready for production use.</emphasis></para>
  </blockquote>

<para>Curious to know what the community had uncovered in "rigorous
testing," I went back to the repository to look at its recent change
history.  The project was still on revision 3.  Apparently, they
hadn't found a <emphasis>single</emphasis> bug worth fixing before the
release!  Thinking that the results of the community testing must have
been recorded elsewhere, I next examined the bug tracker.  There were
exactly six open tickets, four of which had been open for several months
already.</para>

<para>This beggars belief, of course.  When testers pound on a large
and complex piece of software for any length of time, they will find
bugs.  Even if the fixes for those bugs don't make it into the
upcoming release, one would still expect some version control activity
as a result of the testing process, or at least some new tickets.  Yet
to all appearances, nothing had happened between the announcement of
the open source license and the first open source release.</para>

<para>The point is not that the company was lying about the "rigorous
testing" by the community (though I suspect they were).  The point is
that they were oblivious to how much it <emphasis>looked</emphasis> like
they were lying.  Since neither the version control repository nor the
ticket tracker gave any indication that the alleged rigorous testing
had occurred, the company should either not have made the claim in the
first place, or should have provided a clear link to some tangible
result of that testing ("We found 278 bugs; click here for details").
The latter would have allowed anyone to get a handle on the level of
community activity very quickly.  As it was, it only took me a few
minutes to determine that whatever this community testing was, it had
not left traces in any of the usual places.  That's not a lot of
effort, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who took the trouble.</para>

<para>Transparency and verifiability are also an important part of
accurate crediting, of course.  See

<sect2 id="competing-products">
<title>Don't Bash Competing Open Source Products</title>

<para>Refrain from giving negative opinions about competing open
source software.  It's perfectly okay to give negative
<emphasis>facts</emphasis>&mdash;that is, easily confirmable
assertions of the sort often seen in good comparison charts.  But
negative characterizations of a less rigorous nature are best avoided,
for two reasons.  First, they are liable to start flame wars that
detract from productive discussion.  Second, and more importantly,
some of the volunteer developers in <emphasis>your</emphasis> project
may turn out to work on the competing project as well.  This is more
likely than it at first might seem: the projects are already in the
same domain (that's why they're in competition), and developers with
expertise in that domain may make contributions wherever their
expertise is applicable.  Even when there is no direct developer
overlap, it is likely that developers on your project are at least
acquainted with developers on related projects.  Their ability to
maintain constructive personal ties could be hampered by
overly negative marketing messages.</para>

<para>Bashing competing closed-source products seems to be more widely
accepted in the open source world, especially when those products are
made by Microsoft.  Personally, I deplore this tendency (though again,
there's nothing wrong with straightforward factual comparisons), not
merely because it's rude, but also because it's dangerous for a
project to start believing its own hype and thereby ignore the ways in
which the competition may actually be superior.  In general, watch out
for the effect that marketing statements can have on your own
development community.  People may be so excited at being backed by
marketing dollars that they lose objectivity about their software's
true strengths and weaknesses.  It is normal, and even expected, for a
company's developers to exhibit a certain detachment toward marketing
statements, even in public forums.  Clearly, they should not come out
and contradict the marketing message directly (unless it's actually
wrong, though one hopes that sort of thing would have been caught
earlier).  But they may poke fun at it from time to time, as a way of
bringing the rest of the development community back down to
earth.</para>

<!-- possv2 todo: What other marketing advice?

     * Market the lack of lock-in

     * If you're the leader, highlight your competitors; you'll look
       good by comparison, _and_ it emphasizes the lack of lock-in.

     * Remember that your developers have to work with developers
       employed by your competitors.
