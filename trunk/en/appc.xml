<title>Obsolete Appendix (was: Free Bug Trackers)</title>

<simplesect>

<para>I used to maintain here a list of all the open source bug
trackers I knew anything about, with comments on some of them.  Bug
trackers are still an active area of development and experimentation,
perhaps even more so than version control systems (see <xref
linkend="vc-systems"/>), and I've found it increasingly unsustainable to
maintain an appendix that stays up-to-date with the field.  While I
have personal preferences&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;I particularly like <ulink
url="http://www.redmine.org/" >Redmine</ulink>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;the
important thing is that whatever tracker you choose, it have the
features needed to support an active open source community; those
features are discussed in detail in <xref
linkend="bug-tracker"/>.</para>

<para>For lists of bug trackers and comparisons between them, try

Comparison of Issue Tracking Systems</ulink>.</para>
