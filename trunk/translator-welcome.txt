Thank you.  I've set up user "USERNAME" with password "PASSWORD", for
the ProducingOSS Subversion repository:

   http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/producingoss/trunk/

The LANGUAGE translation area is here:

   http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/producingoss/trunk/TWO_LETTER_LANGUAGE

If you're not familiar with Subversion, see svnbook.red-bean.com, or see

   http://producingoss.com/translations.html#guidelines

(Or just post to the mailing list for help -- see below about the list.)

Please note that your commit access applies to the entire repository.
While most of your commits will probably be in the LANGUAGE area, if
you see a mistake elsewhere, for example in the English text, you
should feel free to correct it.  Everything's under version control,
so there's no need to be too cautious :-).

If you want a different password, you can change it here:

   http://www.red-bean.com/wpct/wpct-shared.cgi

(You'll need the old password to get in, of course.)

You're also subscribed to the <producingoss-translators@red-bean.com>
mailing list now.  You'll get a separate automated message about that.

If you have any questions, just mail the list.  I'm on the list and
will see your questions.

Thanks!

-Karl
