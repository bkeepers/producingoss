     Oh Most Wise and Majestic Emacs, please be in -*- text -*- mode!

* mailing lists: discussion about setting Reply-to
* Alex's friend!
* discussion about always asking someone to do something, but tell
    them to ping you if they can't, and remember independently anyway.
* CIA / RSS  ... really, *all* standard tools (freenode!)
* Freshmeat / SourceForge "vitality" measures and what they really mean
* bikesheds (mail Poul-Henning Kemp)
* user account mgmt on the project web site?
* tell the Jefferson story, in the "productive threads" &
  "non-drive-by proposals" department.
* the tension between shared culture and hostile exclusivity
* politics: why horse-trading is inevitable, whether acknowledged or not
* do a grep for "issue", replace with "bug", just in case

* Ben points out that the way we filter the issue tracker is very
  unusual.  We've essentially subscribed all of dev@ to parallize the
  filtering process :-).  This is not the norm, but it may be worth
  recommending.

* other useful sites: ask ghudson about that patch trading site?

* jim's point about how your writing *is* you on the 'Net.

* talk about the wide varieties of psychological preparedness for open
  development among different people (Mikes vs Noels).

* "Software Development and Cosmic Rays" essay, ~/mail/sp-outwent
  (where else?  oh, duh, in www/writings)

* Ben's notes on People Behaving Badly (see ben.txt)

* another example: inclusion of internal issue numbers in scarab commits

* What is rude / not rude in the free software world?
    - technical criticism is a form of flattery
    - unadorned questions are less often rhetorical or mocking
    - accusing someone of a certain "tone" without concrete examples
    - not taking time to *provide* concrete examples, and not
      acknowledging that one has not taken the time.  None of this
      means that you must do these things every time; rather, it
      means you must recognize when you don't that you have fallen on
      one side of a cultural norm, and this must be acknowledged
      and/or accounted for in some way.

* Footnote the word "culture" with a note that academic
  anthropologists study free software culture: <footnote><para>Though
  there <emphasis>are</emphasis> academic anthropologists studying
  free software culture, for example see <ulink
  url="http://www.healthhacker.com/biella/"/>.</para></footnote>

* Bruno Latour: "Aramis"!

* "Here is what I was *going* to write: that a good maintainer must
  often play the role of 'honest broker', and conspicuously avoid
  taking a stand on a technical or process issue at first, attempting
  instead to elicit the best arguments from all parties so the
  tradeoffs are laid out before everyone.  But in practice, have I
  done this?  No, instead I almost always take an initial stand, and
  then flip-flop several times during the course of the discussion."
  Is this as productive, and if so why?  If not, what effects *does*
  it have?

* the "lone genuis" exception: you can get a lot done if you're just
  *that* good.  But then, you probably don't need this book.

  I have several friends who know [omitted] to some degree.  One of them
  said "he often walks the fine line between genius and lunatic."  The
  problem is, genius is such a commodity these days, that it's not
  acceptable to be an eccentric any more.

* The Debian New Maintainer process as a fantastic example of
  conscious training / indoctrination.

* Conversation with Sander, re: ASF guidelines, territoriality,
  <author> tags, etc.

* Shane's response to my slashcode-general post is a *perfect* example
  of what sounds like coldness, but is actually an unadorned offer to
  help.  It's in examples.mbox.

* Open Source's take on the terminology question:

* Express the turns-out-to-be wrong thought that a free-beer
  application can kill off any possibility of an open source app
  taking its place (thought this was happening with Netscape).  It's
  not true; it just slows the open source app development down a bit.
  Acknowledge the Mozilla mistake.

* Jim's point about co-ops that weren't content just to solve a
  limited problem, but had to solve *everything*.  "Okay, I can see
  how this ensures we have access to whole grains through the winter,
  but how does it solve the problems of world hunger, and is it doing
  anything to bring relief to oppressed peoples?"
