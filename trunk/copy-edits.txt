* Chapter 1:

  page 4:   No commas around "in general".

  page 7:   IMP: (top): Leave comma after double quote in '"free software",'
            because this is a verbatim excerpt from a web page.
            (footnote): Leave comma after double quote, as the double
            quotes delimit a verbatim string.

  page 9:   Changing "Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)" to Roman
            letters is fine, but note that I'm just using the
            <firstterm> element in XML, and italics is simply what the
            stylesheet produces for <firstterm>.  Leaving the source
            as-is seems the right thing to do.  Same with "X Window
            System" later on that page.

  page 10:  (near bottom): No commas around "of course".
            (footnote): Leave commas outside double quotes.

  page 11:  No comma necessary after "free software".

  page 12:  Leave comma after double quote after "free".

  page 13:  Leave comma after double quote after "our convictions".
  
* Chapter 2:

  page 19:  Changing titles to Roman letters with double quotes is
            fine, if you want, but note that the plain italics result
            from my use of <citetitle>, i.e., from O'Reilly's stylesheet :-).

  page 22:  Leave comma after double-quote after "everyone".

  page 23:  No commas around "of course".

  page 24:  (top): I don't know what's up with the missing closing
            double quotes after cross-references, of which this is the
            first instance of many.  The problem doesn't exist in my
            generated PDF or HTML, and I'm just using <xref>, naturally.
            (bottom): Leave comma after double quote after "as a community".

  page 25:  (top): Same as above re "as a community".
            (bottom): Leave comma after double-quote after "open
            source software".

  page 28:  IMP: The suggestion to add "...in Chapter 7" after two
            references is good, but causes some awkward repetition.  I
            resolved that by combining the tiny concluding paragraph
            (the one with the second reference) with the paragraph
            before it.  The text now reads:

               A detailed discussion of version numbering can be found
               in "Release Numbering", and the details of
               standardizing build and installation procedures are
               covered in "Packaging", both in Chapter 7.

            If you can't make such a major edit, don't worry about
            it.  It's okay for this minor difference to exist between
            the master and what's in production now.

  page 32:  I corrected "browseable" to "browsable".  (This was
            something you had done everywhere else, and just missed
            this one spot I think.)

  page 36:  No commas around "in itself", they would make the text too
            halting.

  page 40:  No comma between "enforcement" and "per se" (too halting).
  
* Chapter 3:

  page 47:  Don't convert listing commas to semicolons, because, among
            other things, it would orphan the final "etc".  (However,
            the same conversion on the next page is fine, because
            they're compound phrases, and there's no final "etc".)

  page 48:  Leave comma after double quote after "for the record".

  page 50:  (top): Leave period after double quote after "change porting".
            (middle): Instead of adding the words "in Chapter 3", I
            added "later in this chapter", since this is Chapter 3.

  page 51:  (top): This wasn't in your copy edits, but I realized the
            word "various" was repeated in the first paragraph, so I
            deleted the phrase "various sorts of" to fix it.

  page 53:  No comma after "queue".

  page 55:  I think "mailreading" and "mailreader" are single words
            now, and therefore have left them as-is throughout

  page 56:  Leave comma after double quote after "list".

  page 57:  (top): Instead of puttig a comma between "post" and
            "asking", I changed it to "post to ask".
            (middle): Getting rid of the conjunction "And" entirely
            distorts the meaning of the paragraph a bit, so instead I
            redid that part like so: "...into private email threads;
            furthermore, this chapter is all about...".

  page 59:  (middle): No comma after "therefore".
            (bottom): "http://www.metasystema.net/essays/reply-to.mhtml"
            is the correct, canonical URL.

  page 63:  Leave period after double quote after "change".

  page 64:  Leave period after double quote after "up-to-date".

  page 65:  Leave periods or commas after double quotes after
            "revision", "change", "lines of development", "main
            branch", and "trunk".

  page 67:  (top): Leave commas/periods after double quotes after
            "revision", "Version 1.0", and "change control".
            (middle): The home page URL for CVS has changed, it's now
            "http://www.nongnu.org/cvs".  The old URL is forwarding,
            so it's not a big deal, but I am now using the new URL in
            the master, and if we can make that change for the print
            edition too, that'd be great.

  page 69:  Roman vs italic is again an XML/stylesheet thing, just FYI.

  page 75:  Getting rid of the word "So," at the beginning of the
            paragraph is good, but some sort of transition is still
            necessary, because that paragraph is a summing-up of what
            came before.  I replaced the "So," with "In summary," -- 
            not stylistically ideal, but it'll do the job.

  page 80:  IMP: No comma after "person", because adding the comma
            changes the meaning very slightly.

  page 81:  Closing the spaces on either side of the slash would cause
            "IRC" and "Real-Time" to bind too closely with each other.
            In other words, it would be as though we were combining
            two adjectives ("IRC" and "Real-Time") and applying them
            both to "Chat Systems".  But that's not what's intended;
            the slash is actually supposed to divide "IRC" from
            "Real-Time Chat Systems".  So I think the spacing is
            necessary.

  page 82:  IMP: no comma after "irc.freenode.net", this is a quote.

  page 83:  Leave period after double quote after "diff-cmd".

  page 85:  Leave hyphen in "well-suited" because the entire compound
            is modified by an adverb preceding it; also, according
            to Fowler's guidelines on hyphening, the stresses here
            indicate that a hyphen is appropriate.  Not that I think
            the concept of authority has much meaning in questions of
            usage, but Fowler is pretty sensible.  For more detail
            than anyone could possibly want on this vexing question,
            see http://tinyurl.com/d9t3k (search for "Fowler" there).

  page 87:  Leave period after double quote after "home address".
  
* Chapter 4:

  page 92:  Leave hyphen in "centrally-controlled", in part for
            symmetry with "self-organizing" preceding it.

  page 93:  I omitted "their" from "by virtue of their personality",
            because it's not necessary, and omitting it avoids the
            he/she question.
            (middle): Leave period after double quote after "judge".
            Do not insert "of" after "make all".

  page 94:  No comma after "in fact".

  page 95:  Leave comma after double quote after "evolutionarily stable".

  page 101: IMP: Leave "...in itself, but...".  In other words, don't
            turn the comma into a semicolon, and don't omit the "but";
            the conjunction is necessary for a sense of contradiction.

  page 103: Something is apparently adding periods (?) or some other
            symbol after URLs.  There's nothing there in my source
            text.  I'm not sure what you were seeing (because the
            strikeout marks obscure it), but whatever it was, I didn't
            put it there :-).
  
* Chapter 5:

  page 105: No commas around "too".

  page 107: There's a note here about trailing slashes on URLs, but no
            final verdict.  I recommend we leave them on, as that is
            most correct (at least according to web geeks), and I've
            made sure the master is consistent in this regard.

  page 108: Leave hyphens in "well-suited" and "widely-used" (see
            above re Fowler).

  page 115: IMP: Agree with the need for a fix after "predicted", but 
            fixed it in a slightly different way, with a full stop and
            then a semicolon.  Text now reads: "...cannot be precisely
            predicted.  If the contractor is paid by the hour, you may
            end up paying more than you expected; if he is paid a flat
            sum, he may end up doing more work than he can afford."

  page 117: IMP: (top): No comma in "in in".  Adding the comma would
            change the scope of the qualifying phrase at the end in
            an unintended way.
            (middle): No comma after "in any case".

  page 119: (top): Leave comma after "improve", because we need the
            final phrase to modify the entire preceding clause, not
            just the infinitive verb in the preceding clause.
            (middle): No commas around "unfortunately".

  page 123: IMP: (middle): Not quite the right fix, I think.  Instead,
            I rewrote it like this: "...find itself considering how to
            market themselves, the software, or their relationship to
            the software."

  page 124: No commas around "in itself".
  
* Chapter 6:

  page 131: No comma after "and in general".

  page 132: No comma before "per se".

  page 133: IMP: The word really is "emoticlue".  It doesn't mean quite
            the same thing as "emoticon", since an emoticon is always
            a picture, whereas an emoticlue can be a textual indicator,
            for example "<grin>" in an email message.

  page 134: Agreed with Andy, changed "recusals" to "blandishments".

  page 136: IMP: (top): No comma after "for example", as we need it to
            bind rightward unambiguously.
            (middle): Leave commas after double quotes after "doctor"
            and "professor", and no need to add "or".

  page 138: (middle): No commas around "in particular"
            (bottom): Leave comma after double quote after "Me too!",
            especially given the exclamation point.
            IMP: (very bottom): In the second-to-last line, the
            reference to Chapter 3 is wrong, it should be Appendix C

  page 140: Leave comma after double quote after "we".

  page 141: IMP: (top): Leave the comma after "developers", it is
            necessary to avoid an overly narrow qualification.
            (middle): The italics for "Bikeshed Effect" are only
            because I'm using <firstterm>.

  page 144: IMP: Leave comma after "case", it is needed for balance
            with the "yet" coming shortly thereafter.

  page 145: No comma after "difficult", and leave period after double
            quote after "rude" (on the same line).

  page 148: (top): The second name listed in the email excerpt is
            clearly messed up, although it comes out all right when I
            generate HTML.  It's supposed to be a "C" with a caron
            over it (looks like a "C" with a tiny, slightly flattened
            lower-case "v" above it).

  page 149: (low top): Leave comma after double quote after "users",
            after "discuss", and after "help".
            (bottom): No commas around "at any rate", because adding
            them makes that stretch of text too halting.

  page 155: The second paragraph still has some "they/their"
            problems.  To fix, replace "they'd" with "he'd" both
            times, and "their" with "his" once.

  page 156: Leave hyphen in "friendly-reminder" for symmetry with
            "handcuffs-and-jail" right afterwards.

  page 157: Leave comma after single quote after 'r12828', and don't
            add a comma on the next line after 12828.  (That whole
            example needs to be written as a hacker would actually
            write it, which means using hacker-style quoting.)  Later
            in the page, leave comma after double quote after
            "revision 12828".
            IMP: No comma between "for example" and "to use on a
            laptop while traveling".  Adding the comma changes the
            meaning slightly, because it makes the "for example" seem
            like it's saying that keeping offline copies is an example
            of something, instead of saying that use on a laptop while
            traveling is an example of why people keep offline copies.

  page 158: Leave the comma and the "but" in "...do it in the tracker,
            but...".  The opposition of the two sides is meaningful
            and needs to be highlighted with a conjunction.  (Later on
            near the bottom of the page, removing the "but" is okay
            because the point has already been made.)

  page 160: Leave comma after double quote after "subscribers", and
            later after "announce".

  page 162: Leave comma after double quote after "trusted".

  page 164: No commas around "too".

  page 165: IMP: Leave period after double quote after "CVE".
            Hacker-style quoting is really necessary here.

  page 167: (top): Although we say "GPLed" instead of "GPL'd"
            everywhere, we have left "BCC'd" alone.  That's fine with
            me, I just wanted to call it to your attention in case it
            was an oversight.  I actually prefer it this way, despite
            the inconsistency; somehow it seems intuitively right.
  
* Chapter 7:

  page 171: Leave as "agreed on", not "agreed upon".
            Leave comma after double quote after "0.95".

  page 172: IMP: On this page, the comma/period after a double quote
            thing is important as these are all literal strings whose
            precise contents are important: "Stable", "Unstable",
            "Development", "Beta", "Scanley 2.3.0 (RC)", "Scanley
            2.3.0 (RC 1)".
            (bottom): Leave the "ly" on "differently".  It's still an
            adverb, even though it's being modified by another adverb.

  page 173: IMP: Same about commas after double quotes, for "3.14.159"
            and "3.15.anything".
            (bottom): Leave hyphen in "widely-used".

  page 174: Leave "bug fixes" as two words, as per Andy's note back on
            page 117, with which I agree.  (Might be good to do a
            search for "bugfix" throughout the book and add the space
            where necessary, just in case.  There are two instances
            just on page 174, for example.)

  page 176: Leave comma after double quote after "0".
            No comma between "at least" and "does".
            Leave hyphen in "Newly-started".

  page 177: Leave comma after double quote after "3.5.1".

  page 179: Leave period after double quote after "deciding".

  page 180: (top): Leave period after double quote after "no".
            (middle): No comma after "in the end"

  page 181: No comma after "in theory".
            Leave hyphen in "well-written" (though it's an edge case,
            I admit).

  page 184: Leave comma after double quote after "Scanley 2.5.0".

  page 185: (sidebar): Leave comma after double quote after "Tape
            ARchive" [sic].  Also, I did not capitalize the word "tar"
            because people do not seem to capitalize it in regular usage.
            (middle): I added "using zip compression" right after "or
            for Windows" (and before the colon), to clarify a point.
            It's not a big deal if that doesn't make it into the print
            version, but if it can, that would be nice.

  page 186: (middle): No comma after "for example".
            (upper bottom): No commas around "in fact"
            No comma between "is the same" and "regardless of".

  page 187: (sidebar): No commas around "too".  Leave comma after
            double quote after "ChangeLog".
            (bottom): Levae commas after double quotes after "MySQL
            5.0" and "Scanley 2.5.0".

  page 188: No "s" on the end of "use" -- was deliberately aiming for
            that 3rd person imperative flavor.

  page 190: There's another "bug fixes" that should stay "bug fixes" here.

  page 192: No comma after "of course".

  page 193: Adding "best" before "interests" is unnecessary, maybe
            even sounds a bit clichéd?

  page 195: No comma after "thrown in".

  page 196: Instead of removing the hyphen from "up-front", I changed
            the word order a bit, it now reads: "A little up-front
            discipline on everyone's part...".

  page 197: IMP: Leave comma after "friction caused, ...", removing it
            would change the meaning.
            (bottom): Leave comma after double quote after "meeting".
  
* Chapter 8:

  page 199: I've always written "grab-bag" with a hyphen; for what
            it's worth the O.E.D. agrees.
            IMP: (middle): Reversing the possessive apostrophe with
            the period after it didn't make sense to me -- are you
            sure that's what you wanted?
            (bottom): Use of "are" instead of "have" is deliberate;
            I want a stative effect instead of the usual auxiliary
            verb effect.

  page 200: (top): Change "their" to "his" instead of "her", to match
            the pronouns used in the next paragraph, whose topic is a
            continuation of this paragraph's.  Leave hyphen in
            "horse-trading" because it is needed to prevent "outright"
            from modifying "horse" alone instead of the compound -- I
            know it's a stretch, but the hyphen does aid clarity a bit.
            I admit there's no support from O.E.D. on "horse-trading",
            though.
            (middle): I added "multiple" before "real-world" to
            clarify the meaning.
            (footnote): The italic instead of Roman is, again, due to
            use of <citetitle>.

  page 201: IMP: Leave as "...whether or not that actually helps...".
            Changing it to "they ... help" would change the meaning.

  page 205: Don't add "of" after "more".  That would change the object
            into a mass noun instead of a plain plural.

  page 206: No comma after "in practice", it's too halting with the comma.

  page 207: I left out an article, sorry: "a contrib/ area" instead of
            "contrib/ areas".

  page 208: Since we changed "10" to "ten", I changed "20" to "twenty"
            at the end of the same paragraph.
            (middle): Leave comma after double quote after "project manager".

  page 209: (sidebar): Leave hyphen in "already-fixed", to make a firm
            compound adjective.

  page 210: Don't add "the ... that ..." to "the fewer bugs will survive",
            it doesn't change the meaning, it just sounds fussier (IMHO).

  page 212: (bottom): Removing the comma after "effective" was good;
            I went further and simplified "in terms of" to "at".

  page 213: Change "themselves" to "herself" not "himself", for
            consistency with earlier text.

  page 217: (middle): Leave comma after "repository", and don't put
            commas around "indeed".

  page 218: (upper bottom): No commas around "or affect".  But I redid
            the entire last sentence.  It now reads: "In many cases,
            patches will overlap with or affect other patches, and
            need to be adjusted with respect to each other before
            being committed."  This is clearer anyway.

  page 219: (sidebar): No comma after "in fact".

  page 220: IMP: Leave comma after "database", and don't add a comma
            between "it" and "looking".  This preserves the intended
            phrase division.
            (bottom): Another "bug fix" to leave as it is.

  page 221: Leave as "on", not "upon".  (Mayb I'm secretly British...?)

  page 222: Don't insert "with" between "users" and "what".
            No comma between "case" and "misleads".

  page 223: Leave the word "then", it's needed to indicate relative time.
            (bottom): Use "her" instead of "his", to agree with
            earlier text.

  page 226: Changed "them" to "him" in phrase "give them commit access".

  page 227: Leave comma after double quote after "sandbox".
            No comma after "quickly".
            No comma after "but in this case", because then we would
            also need one after "but", and that would make the
            sentence too halting.

  page 230: Leave "already" in "whose name is already recorded".  It
            may be redundant, but it is still useful, I think.

  page 231: Leave as "comment", not "comments" (mass noun intentional).
            (upper bottom): I changed "go for" to "aim for", to be a
            bit more formal.

  page 232: No commas around "or all", because "some or all of" is a
            common idiom.
            Don't make a full stop after "territory", I think we need
            both thoughts to be part of the same sentence.

  page 234: The whole GCC acronym expansion text got complicated.  I
            had to rewrite it, here's how it looks now, with some
            context: "A famous instance of this was the GCC/EGCS fork.
            The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC, formerly the GNU C
            Compiler) is the most popular open source native-code
            compiler, and also one of the most portable compilers in
            the world."
            (bottom): No comma after "case".  We could have two, or
            none, but not one, I think.
  
* Chapter 9:

  page 239: Leave comma after double quote after "open source" and
            "zero cost".

  page 241: Leave hyphen in "widely-used" (twice).
            IMP: No comma after "forkability" (it changes the sense to
            a surprising degree).

  page 246: No comma after "if at all possible".
            Regarding the spaces around the slash in "MIT / X Window",
            see above for p. 81.

  page 247: Leave hyphen in "widely-used".
            (middle): Notice that no spaces around the slash is
            acceptable here because no multiword phrases are involved
            (well, one is, but it's hyphened so it's okay).
            (upper bottom): Leave comma after double quote after "free".

  page 248: Leave period after double quote after "free".
            Leave "acknowledgement" spelled that way, as this is a quote.

  page 250: "bona fide" is italicized because I used <foreignphrase>.
            Common Latin phrases are always a question, I guess; I
            generally treat them as foreign except for "de facto".


  page 251: Another "bug fixes" to leave alone.

  page 252: IMP: No comma after "worst", including one changes binding.

  page 253: No comma after "lawyers".

  page 254: No comma after "in the end".
  
* Appendix A:

  page 257: No comma after "in the last few years".

  page 258: Leave comma after double quote after "archive".
            Also, I took your advice and removed the "[sic]".

  page 259: I didn't incorporate any of the changes on this page,
            since I wasn't sure whether you had made them or not.
  
* Appendix B:

  page 263: Changed title to "Free Bug Trackers", after talking with Andy.
            (first paragraph): Not sure how "s" got on the end of
            "trackers" here, it's not that way in my sources.

  page 264: In the entry for "Trac", I rewrote the second sentence
            like this: "It uses wiki linking to connect issues, files,
            version control changesets, and plain wiki pages."
  
* Appendix C:

  page 267: Removed the phrase "in its entirety", for reasons that
            will become clear below.

  page 271: IMP: Changed "Brett Glass" to "[omitted]".  I don't know
            much about Brett Glass, beyond what's in this post, and it
            doesn't seem fair for Poul-Henning Kamp's condemnation of
            him to be frozen in print for all time.  Of course, this
            change omits a tiny bit from Kamp's original post, hence
            the corresponding change on page 267 above.

  page 272: IMP: There were TAB characters in the original source,
            that's why the ascii vertical lines got messed up.  They
            should be straight lines, not ragged, of course.  I've
            fixed this in the master; can you fix it in production?

  page 273: Same as page 272.

  page 274: Replaced "Brett Glasses" with "[omitted]s", see page 271
            notes for more.
  
* Appendix D:

  page 275: Leave hyphen in "lightly-edited".
