<title> Design to Support Division of Labor </title>

<para><remark>How to make the project's architecture support division
among many workers.  (Example: According to Tim [via Andy], Linus said
that he found it easier to get volunteers because he knew how to break
down the functionality or source code into chunks that different
people could handle.)  This will tie into material in Chapter

       - release management
       - documentation and FAQ maintenance
       - distributing meta-management tasks. 
       - mailing list moderation

<para><remark>Regarding FAQ maintenance: must be html, must have links
for the individual questions (as per chapter 6, sec 4.1).  Delegate,
delegate, delegate: get a FAQ manager, a human who will be able to
follow and sort out a thread, post a proposed FAQ entry, recognize
approval/disapproval and incorporate comments, and add it to the FAQ.
Comment on the disaster that is FAQ-o-Matic, at least when it is
misapplied.</remark></para>
