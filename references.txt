    Thanks Ron, Tom and Jason for the kind words.  I started
    a page with a collection of links to online resources on
    branching and merging at
     <http://cmwiki.bradapp.net/BranchingAndMerging>
    
    You'll find several papers there that deal with
    branching and release management policy (including
    stuff written by folks other than myself :-)
    
    I also highly recommend Michael E. Bays book
    "Software Release Methodology"

  Zak Greant was a key spokesperson for MySQL, and he has thought
  deeply about their funding and business model. Now he's moved on,
  but I believe you can still reach him through zak@mysql.com. I've
  talked to him a lot and I'm sure he'd be willing to talk to you for
  your book.
