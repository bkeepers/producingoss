  Recommended on the Subversion user's list:

     + Roundup.
       http://roundup.sourceforge.net/

       "Mainly its simplicity. All it does is track issues. It took 5
        minutes to install, allowing me to add issues right
        away. We've been using it for about two months now.

        It is _very_ easy to customize. Its written in python,
        although you don't really need to know any to customize it. I
        added a difficulty field to the DB yesterday and colorized our
        issue lists based on this in about 20 minutes. This involved
        adding about three lines of python and changing the web
        interface templates a bit.

        It keeps track of all the changes that ever occured in the
        system. The default schema is quite sane.

        I did find some of the "detectors" installed by default
        annoying -- they would change the status of the issue,
        e.g. from "resolved" to "chatting" if you added a message to a
        resolved issue. But this was again trivial to change.

     + Trac
       http://trac.edgewall.com/

       Simple to setup.  Integration with Subversion.  Has a Wiki,
       allowing documentation to be readily available to the users.

       Trac also "understands" Subversion log messages, and
       automatically creates links.  For example, if in a log message
       I put "Closes #1", #1 will be a hyperlink when viewed over the
       web, linking to issue #1.

       There are other hyperlink conventions built-in.

       There is also a Python post-commit script floating around that
       reads the committed log message, and updates the issue database
       accordingly.

     + Scmbug
       http://freshmeat.net/projects/scmbug

       Scmbug is a system that integrates software configuration
       management with bug-tracking. It aims to be a universal tool
       that can glue any source code version control system (such as
       CVS, Subversion, and arch) with any bug-tracking system (such
       as Bugzilla and GNATS)

  From http://linas.org/linux/pm.html:

     + Bugzilla
       http://www.bugzilla.org/
       "Bugzilla is a "Defect Tracking System" or "Bug-Tracking
        System". Defect Tracking Systems allow individual or groups of
        developers to keep track of outstanding bugs in their product
        effectively. Most commercial defect-tracking software vendors
        charge enormous licensing fees. Despite being "free", Bugzilla
        has many features its expensive counterparts
        lack. Consequently, Bugzilla has quickly become a favorite of
        hundreds of organizations across the globe.

     + GNATS
       http://www.gnu.org/software/gnats/

     + DBTS - Debian Bug Tracking System
       http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/debbugs/

       "The Debian bug tracking system is a set of scripts which
        maintain a database of problem reports.  Key features:
        - All input and manipulation of reports is done by email;
          developers do not need on-line web access or accounts on the
          host system. 
        - Outstanding, recently closed and other listings of reports
          are made available via a webserver, and by an email request
          bot.
        - Each report has a separate email address for submission of
          additional information. 
        - WWW listings of bugs can be mirrored by email or HTTP. 
        - Core functions do not require CGI scripts. 
        - The Debian Project's instance has handled 16000 reports over
          the past 3-4 years, and currently has a database of 5000
          reports totalling 90Mb (January 1997). 

     + RT - RequestTracker
       http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/

       "RT is an enterprise-grade ticketing system which enables a
        group of people to intelligently and efficiently manage tasks,
        issues, and requests submitted by a community of users.

        The RT platform has been under development since 1996, and is
        used by systems administrators, customer support staffs, IT
        managers, developers and marketing departments at thousands of
        sites around the world.

        Written in object-oriented Perl, RT is a high-level, portable,
        platform independent system that eases collaboration within
        organizations and makes it easy for them to take care of their
        customers.

        RT manages key tasks such as the identification,
        prioritization, assignment, resolution and notification
        required by enterprise-critical applications including project
        management, help desk, NOC ticketing, CRM and software
        development.

        RT is used by Fortune 100 companies, government agencies,
        educational institutions, and development organizations
        worldwide."

     + Scarab
       http://scarab.tigris.org/

     + http://www.mantisbt.org/
       "Mantis is a web-based bugtracking system. It is written in the
        PHP scripting language and requires the MySQL database and a
        webserver. Mantis has been installed on Windows, MacOS, OS/2,
        and a variety of Unix operating systems. Almost any web
        browser should be able to function as a client."

     + WebCall

       "Ticket Tracking System for Linux running on mySQL"

     + Teacup
       http://www.altara.org/teacup.html

       "Teacup is a CGI application, based on Perl 5 and PostgreSQL,
        designed to provide helpdesk problem report management for
        small to medium size organizations. It includes web and email
        interfaces for submitting, updating, and querying problem
        reports. Complete documentation for the Teacup PRMS is
        available here."

     + Bluetail Ticket Tracker
       http://btt.sourceforge.net/
       "The Bluetail Ticket Tracker (BTT) is a system for creating,
        storing and keeping track of tickets. A ticket describes an
        issue of some sort.  It can, for example, be a Trouble Report
        or a ToDo note."
