  vanishingly rare cases where software can be open but not free,

     + Bugzilla
       http://www.bugzilla.org/
       "Bugzilla is a "Defect Tracking System" or "Bug-Tracking
        System". Defect Tracking Systems allow individual or groups of
        developers to keep track of outstanding bugs in their product
        effectively. Most commercial defect-tracking software vendors
        charge enormous licensing fees. Despite being "free", Bugzilla
        has many features its expensive counterparts
        lack. Consequently, Bugzilla has quickly become a favorite of
        hundreds of organizations across the globe.

     + DBTS - Debian Bug Tracking System
       http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/debbugs/

       "The Debian bug tracking system is a set of scripts which
        maintain a database of problem reports.  Key features:
        - All input and manipulation of reports is done by email;
          developers do not need on-line web access or accounts on the
          host system. 
        - Outstanding, recently closed and other listings of reports
          are made available via a webserver, and by an email request
          bot.
        - Each report has a separate email address for submission of
          additional information. 
        - WWW listings of bugs can be mirrored by email or HTTP. 
        - Core functions do not require CGI scripts. 
        - The Debian Project's instance has handled 16000 reports over
          the past 3-4 years, and currently has a database of 5000
          reports totalling 90Mb (January 1997). 

     + RT - RequestTracker
       http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/

       "RT is an enterprise-grade ticketing system which enables a
        group of people to intelligently and efficiently manage tasks,
        issues, and requests submitted by a community of users.

        The RT platform has been under development since 1996, and is
        used by systems administrators, customer support staffs, IT
        managers, developers and marketing departments at thousands of
        sites around the world.

        Written in object-oriented Perl, RT is a high-level, portable,
        platform independent system that eases collaboration within
        organizations and makes it easy for them to take care of their
        customers.

        RT manages key tasks such as the identification,
        prioritization, assignment, resolution and notification
        required by enterprise-critical applications including project
        management, help desk, NOC ticketing, CRM and software
        development.

        RT is used by Fortune 100 companies, government agencies,
        educational institutions, and development organizations
        worldwide."
