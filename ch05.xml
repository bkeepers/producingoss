<sect1 id="pfs-ch-5-sect-1">
<title> Avoiding Common Pitfalls </title>

<para> Avoiding common pitfalls; distinguishing productive threads
from unproductive ones; guiding threads toward usefulness without
being pushy.  </para>

</sect1>


<!-- ======================== SECTION ============================== -->
<sect1 id="pfs-ch-5-sect-2">
<title> Difficult People </title>

<para> Dealing with difficult/rude participants on mailing lists.
Also, dealing with people who misuse or abuse procedural forms (such
as vetos, voting, filibustering, etc, which sadly
<emphasis>has</emphasis> been known to happen from time to time).  Ask
J about his experiences with you-know-who in this regard.</para>

</sect1>


<!-- ======================== SECTION ============================== -->
<sect1 id="pfs-ch-5-sect-3">
<title>Codifying Tradition</title>

<para><remark>See <ulink
url="http://subversion.tigris.org/mailing-list-guidelines.html"/> for
an example of mailing list guidelines, talk about which problems such
guidelines can solve and which they can't.  Also, log message
guidelines (if that gets its own section, remember to adjust the xref
in Version Control Vocabulary in Chapter 3).  Mention the parseability
concern; point out that it can overdone, too.</remark></para>

</sect1>


<!-- ======================== SECTION ============================== -->
<sect1 id="pfs-ch-5-sect-4">
<title>Conspicuous Use of Archives</title>

<para><remark>The importance of having all communications be logged
and be searchable, with stable references.  Describe the misery that
results when this is not available -- for example, the pain of the
contactor.se/~dast "route around" that resulted from the lossage of
the native tigris.org mail archiver.  Written guidelines vs precedence
is like the distinction between English statutory law and common law.
Good archiving is essential for the same reason.  It's like an oral
tradition with a video camera constantly running.</remark></para>

<para><remark>Perfect example: a named anchor for *every* FAQ
item.</remark></para>

<remark>(Also, get Brian B's story of the FreeBSD IRC archives
here.)</remark>

<para><remark>Redundancy example: ChangeLogs in CVS, 'cvs log', 'svn
log', CIA logs, etc.  Same information, different presentations.
Mention cvs2cl for CVS here?</remark></para>

</sect1>


<!-- ======================== SECTION ============================== -->
<sect1 id="pfs-ch-5-sect-5">
<title> Open vs Private Interactions </title>

<para>When to operate overtly, when to operate behind the scenes.</para>

<para><remark>(Give the example of bouncing a review back to Mike (or
was it Ben?) to have them post it, so the exchange could be public,
even though we were sitting right next to each other.)</remark></para>

</sect1>


<!-- ======================== SECTION ============================== -->
<sect1 id="pfs-ch-5-sect-6">
<title> Internal vs External Communications </title>

<para> Internal vs external communications.  In free software
projects, there tends to be a smooth continuum between purely internal
discussions and public relations statements.  Discuss how to navigate
this continuum.  Describe how to hook into the standard real-time news
distribution forums (RSS, CIA, etc), and the meta-distribution sites
such as Freshmeat.  </para>

</sect1>


<!-- This used to be in Chapter 2.  It's not really about
     communications either, but where is a better place?  Should it
     be cut entirely? 

   Understanding potential volunteers' motivations will help you set
   things up to attract them.  You can't build the lamp until you know
   what frequencies of light the moths are attracted to.  Oh, wait,
   maybe that's not such a good metaphor...

   For example, talk about the sharp distinction between those who
   were interested in reaching 1.0 versus those who were interested in
   adding new features to Subversion.  (Philip, Ghudson, etc.)
