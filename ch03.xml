Some rough categories:
   * Viral copyleft:
       - GPL

   * Trademark/reputation-protecting licenses:
       - Knuth's TeX license
          (see http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2002/08/msg00054.html)
       - Perl's Artistic License

   * Do whatever you want, maybe give us credit:
       - BSD
       - Apache
       - X 
       - what else?

   * Really low overhead license:
       - do anything you want, but this is still a copyrighted work

   * And finally, public domain of course.

   See www.mysql.com / dev.mysql.com / www.innodb.com for an example
   of a dual-licensing strategy where the free half of the license is
   GPL.  How do they handle contributed code?  I don't know.

<title> License Compatibility Issues </title>

<para> License interactions.  (Example: the temporary drifting apart
of PHP and MySQL due to PHP's fear that licensing differences would
prohibit them from distributing MySQL with their code.  We also have
some examples of this problem in Subversion/Apache/BerkeleyDB-land.)
