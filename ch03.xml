<title>Licenses and Copyrights <!-- [ 7-15 pp ] --></title>

<simplesect>

<para> say why it matters </para>

<para> early on, explode the "this is open source but not free"
misusage </para>

Some rough categories:
   * Viral copyleft:
       - GPL

   * Trademark/reputation-protecting licenses:
       - Knuth's TeX license
          (see http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2002/08/msg00054.html)
       - Perl's Artistic License

   * Do whatever you want, maybe give us credit:
       - BSD
       - Apache
       - X 
       - what else?

   * Really low overhead license:
       - do anything you want, but this is still a copyrighted work

   * And finally, public domain of course.

   Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible.  Or Else.

   See www.mysql.com / dev.mysql.com / www.innodb.com for an example
   of a dual-licensing strategy where the free half of the license is
   GPL.  How do they handle contributed code?  I don't know.

------------------------------------
This text was excised from Chapter 2, it might be better used here:

<para>Free software licenses fall into three basic categories:</para>

<orderedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para>Those designed to ensure the software can only be used in
        other free programs.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>Those designed to protect the credit and reputation of the
        author(s) of the software.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>Those designed to allow as wide and unlimited distribution
        of the software as possible, while still retaining copyright
        for the original authors.</para>
  </listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Note that some licenses combine functions (1) and (2), but they
seem to be rarely used.</para>

<para>The most popular type (1) license is the GNU General Public
License, or GPL (see <ulink
url="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL"/>).  The GPL's
most controversial attribute is that any work which uses GPL'd code
must also be released under the GPL.  If all the free software in the
world were under the GPL, this would merely mean that GPL'd code could
be shared among free programs, but not used in proprietary
programs.</para>

<para>However, as there are other free licenses besides the GPL, the
GPL can sometimes prevent (or at least discourage) code-swapping even
between two free programs.  From the point of view of the Free
Software Foundation, these second-order consequences are desirable.
The GPL not only keeps your software free, but effectively makes your
software an agent in pushing <emphasis>other</emphasis> software to
enforce freedom as well.</para>

<para>Whether it's the right license for your project depends on your
goals.  If you want absolutely the widest possible use of the
software, and don't mind its being incorporated into proprietary
programs, the GPL is not a good choice.  If you mainly intend the
project 

</para>

<para>The GPL cannot be categorized as innately business-friendly or
business-unfriendly.  fooo</para>

<para>Depending on your goals, and how you want your program to be
used, this may or may not be what you want.</para>

<para>Perhaps surprisingly, the GPL can make better business sense
than some other licenses, because it prevents competitors from using
the software in a proprietary value-add.</para>

<para>(Competitors often won't mind credit clauses.)</para>

<para>In general, using the GPL may put off some developers; whereas a
non-GPL free license will not put off any.  Nevertheless, I sometimes
use the GPL for personal programs</para>
