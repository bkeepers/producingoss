All of the page numbers here are based on the QC draft.  I've marked
the really important ones with "IMP:".  

* Copyright page:

  IMP: 
      (I believe all of these have been fixed already, just mentioning
      them here so you can use this document as a checklist.)

       - No "TM" after "Open Source", it's not trademarked.
       - Copyright "Karl Fogel", not "O'Reilly Media, Inc."
       - "Some rights reserved" instead of "All rights reserved".

* "About the Author" page:

  IMP:
       (These are also fixed already, I believe.)

       - "KARL FOGEL" not "KEN FOGEL"; also, watch out for weird punctuation.

  Another problem on this page is less important, but if you're fixing
  the page anyway, perhaps you could fix this too:

  I wrote the second sentence clumsily.  Can we change the phrase
  "...added support for CVS anonymous read-only repository access..." to
  "...added support to CVS for anonymous read-only repository access...".
  Thanks.

* Colophon page:

  There are no illustrations in the book (unless the little glyphs
  count?), so the last sentence of the colophon seems odd.  Not sure
  whether you want to keep it, just wanted to point out the
  possibility that it might be a cut-and-paste error.

* Preface

  QC page xix: 
           (first line of the first paragraph of text after bullet points):
           The "course" in "of course" is spuriously in bold font.

* Chapter 1:

  QC page 3:
            (bottom line): No comma after "in general".

  QC page 6:
            IMP: (bottom): Leave comma after double quote in
            '"free software",' because this is a verbatim excerpt from
            a web page.

  QC page 7:
            (footnote): Leave comma after double quote, as the double
            quotes delimit a verbatim string.

  QC page 9:
            (footnote): Leave commas outside double quotes.

  QC page 10:
            (near bottom): No commas around "of course" in "and, of
            course, it always cost less.

  QC page 11:
            (third line of first complete paragraph): No comma
            necessary after "free software" in double quotes; or,
            alternatively, put it outside the double quotes.

  QC page 13:
            (second sentence of first para following web page excerpt):
             Leave comma after double quote after "our convictions".
  
* Chapter 2:

  QC page 22:
            (near middle): Leave comma after double-quote after "everyone".

  QC page 23:
            (second complete paragraph): No commas around "of course".

  QC page 24:
            (second line of last paragraph): Leave comma after double
            quote after "as a community".

  QC page 25:
            (first complete paragraph): Same as above re "as a community".

            (second-to-last paragraph): Leave comma after double-quote
            after "open source software".

  QC page 32:
            (first paragraph of new section): I corrected "browseable"
            to "browsable".  [This was something you had done
            everywhere else, and just missed this one spot I think.]

  QC page 36:
            (first complete paragraph): No commas around "in itself",
            they would make the text a bit halting.

  QC page 40:
            (first paragraph of new section): No comma before "per se",
            also due to haltingness.
  
* Chapter 3:

  page 47 QC page :
            Don't convert listing commas to semicolons, because, among
            other things, it would orphan the final "etc".  (However,
            the same conversion on the next page is fine, because
            they're compound phrases, and there's no final "etc".)

  QC page 48:
            (top line) Leave comma after double quote after "for the record".

  QC page 50:
            (near top): Leave period after double quote after
            "change porting".

            IMP: (last paragraph before new section): Instead of
            adding the words "in Chapter 3", I added "later in this
            chapter", since this is Chapter 3.

  QC page 51:
            (top paragraph): This wasn't in your copy edits, but I
            realized the word "various" was repeated in the first
            paragraph, so I deleted the phrase "various sorts of" to
            fix it.

  QC page 56:
            (first line of bottom paragraph): Leave comma after double
            quote after "list".

  QC page 57:
            (top): Instead of putting a comma between "post" and
            "asking", I changed it to "post to ask".

            IMP: (first paragraph of new section): Getting rid of the
            conjunction "And" distorts the meaning of the paragraph a
            bit, so instead I used a semicolon instead, like so:
            "...from trailing off into private email threads;
            furthermore, this chapter is all about setting up...".

  QC page 59:
            (seventh line of top paragraph): No comma after "therefore".

            IMP: (second bullet point near bottom): The URL there is
            broken.  The correct URL is:
            http://www.metasystema.net/essays/reply-to.mhtml

  QC page 63:
            (near bottom, in definition of "Commit"): Leave period
            after double quote after "change".

  QC page 64:
            (in definition of "Update"): Leave period after double
            quote after "up-to-date".

  QC page 65:
            (in definition of "Revision, change, changeset"): Leave
            commas after double quotes after "revision" and "change".

            (in definition of "Branch"): Leave periods after double
            quotes in "lines of development" and "trunk".

  QC page 67:
            (sidebar): Leave commas/periods after double quotes after
            "revision", "Version 1.0", and "change control".

            (first paragraph of new section): The home URL for CVS has
            changed recently, it's now "http://www.nongnu.org/cvs".
            The old URL is forwarding, so it's not a big deal, but I
            am now using the new URL in the master, and if we can make
            that change for the print edition too, that'd be great.

            IMP: (last paragraph): The phrase "Chapter 1 lists all the
            ones that I know of" should be "Appendix A lists all the
            ones that I know of" instead.  Note that in the XML
            masters, the reference is correct, which means there was
            some error in the tool that converted XML to whatever
            format O'Reilly is using internally.  It might be worth
            checking other references to make sure they did not get
            messed up in a similar way!

  QC page 75:
            (third complete paragraph, the one beginning with "Don't"):
            This paragraph used to start with the word "So," to
            indicate a summing-up transition from the material
            before.  I think some sort of transition is still
            necessary, though agree that "So," wasn't great.  How
            about "In summary," ?  Not stylistically ideal, but it'd do.

  QC page 80:
            IMP: (second complete paragraph): No comma after "person",
            because adding the comma changes the meaning very slightly.

  QC page 82:
            IMP (web page excerpt near top): No comma after
            "irc.freenode.net", this is a quote.

  QC page 83:
            (paragraph beginning "That told the bot..."): Leave period
            after double quote after "diff-cmd", it's a literal string
            referring back to the earlier IRC excerpt.

  QC page 88:
            (third line from top): Leave period after double quote
            after "home address".
  
* Chapter 4:

  QC page 92:
            (fourth line from top): Leave hyphen in "centrally-controlled",
             for symmetry with "self-organizing" preceding it.

  QC page 93:
            (first paragraph in new section): Let's omit "their" from
            "by virtue of their personality", because it's not
            necessary, and by omitting it we can avoid the he/she issue. 

            (next paragraph): Leave period after double quote after
            "judge".  No need for "of" after "make all".

  QC page 94:
            (third complete paragraph, seventh line): No comma after
            "in fact". 

  QC page 95:
            (top line): Leave comma after double quote after
            "evolutionarily stable".

  QC page 101:
            IMP: (first paragraph in new section "Writing It All Down"):
            The last sentence now reads "...in itself; that just...".
            The original text had it "...in itself, but that just..."
            Can we revert it back?  The comma-then-conjunction helped
            convey a sense of contradiction between the two halves.

* Chapter 5:

  QC page 115:
            IMP: (first paragraph under new section "Contracting"):
            Starting from the third-from-last line, let's make the
            sentence structure match the meaning a bit more, by having
            it read like this: "...cannot be precisely predicted.  If
            the contractor is paid by the hour, you may end up paying
            more than you expected; if he is paid a flat sum, he may
            end up doing more work than he can afford."  [In other
            words, full stop after "predicted", then use a semicolon
            instead of a period between the next two sentences.]

  QC page 117:
            IMP: (third line from top): No comma in "in in".  Adding
            the comma changes the scope of the qualifying phrase at
            the end in an unintended way.

  QC page 119:
            (top line): Leave comma after "improve", because we need
            the final phrase to modify the entire preceding clause,
            not just the infinitive verb in the preceding clause.

            (first paragraph in new section): No commas around
            "unfortunately".

  QC page 123:
            IMP: (single paragraph in section "Marketing"): The
            listing structure of the fourth sentence is a bit off, I
            think.  Let's do it like this: "...find itself considering
            how to market themselves, the software, or their
            relationship to the software."

  QC page 124:
            (second complete paragraph, second-to-last sentence): No
            commas around "in itself".
  
* Chapter 6:

  QC page 133:
            IMP: (last sentence of first complete paragraph): The word
            is "emoticlue", not "emoticon".  An emoticon is always a
            picture, whereas an emoticlue can be a purely textual
            indicator, for example "<grin>" in an email message.

  QC page 136:
            (third line): No comma after "for example", as we need it
            to bind unambiguously rightward.

            (fourth pargraph): Leave commas after double quotes after
            "doctor" and "professor", and no need to add "or" before
            "director".

  QC page 138:
            (first paragraph under new heading): No commas around "in
            particular".

            (last paragraph): Leave comma after double quote after "Me
            too!", especially given the exclamation point.

  QC page 140:
            (paragraph beginning with "Contrast..."): Leave comma
            after double quote after "we".

  QC page 141:
            IMP: (first paragraph): Leave the comma after
            "developers", it is necessary to avoid an overly narrow
            qualification.

  QC page 144:
            IMP: (second paragraph): Leave comma after "special case",
            it is needed for balance with the "yet" clause that comes
            a bit later.

  QC page 145:
            (first paragraph under new header): No comma after
            "difficult", and leave period after double quote after
            "rude" on the same line.

  QC page 148:
            IMP: (excerpt at top): The fourth name listed in the email
            excerpt is messed up in print, although it comes out all
            right when I generate HTML.  It's supposed to be "Branko
            Cibej" with caron over the "C" (i.e., a "C" with a tiny,
            slightly flattened lower-case "v" above it).

  QC page 149:
            (first paragraph under new header): Leave comma after
            double quote after "users", after "discuss", and after
            "help".

            (last paragraph): No commas around "at any rate", because
            adding them makes that stretch of text too halting.

  QC page 155:
            (second paragraph):  Still some "they/their" problems
            here.  To fix, replace "they'd" with "he'd" two times,
            and "their" with "his" once.

  QC page 156:
            (third paragraph): Leave hyphen in "friendly-reminder" for
            symmetry with "handcuffs-and-jail" right afterwards.

  QC page 157:
            (top paragraph after excerpt): Leave comma after single
            quote after 'r12828', and don't add a comma on the next
            line after 12828.  (Because that whole example needs to be
            written as a hacker would actually write it, which means
            using hacker-style quoting.)

            (next paragraph, seventh line): Leave comma after double
            quote after "revision 12828".

            IMP: (next paragraph): No comma between "for example" and
            "to use on a laptop while traveling".  Adding the comma
            changes the meaning slightly, because it makes the "for
            example" seem like it's saying that keeping offline copies
            is an example of something, instead of saying that use on
            a laptop while traveling is an example of why people keep
            offline copies.

  QC page 158:
            (fourth paragraph, second line): Change the semicolon back
            to ", but".  The opposition of the two sides is meaningful
            and needs to be highlighted with a conjunction, I think.

  QC page 160:
            (third bullet point): Leave comma after double quote after
            "subscribers".

            (fifth bullet point): Same thing after "announce".

  QC page 162:
            (third line from bottom): Leave comma after double quote
            after "trusted".

  QC page 164:
            (second paragraph, fifth line): No commas around "too".

  QC page 165:
            IMP: (second paragraph, last line): Leave period after
            double quote after "CVE", it's a literal string.

* Chapter 7:

  QC page 171:
            (third paragraph after bullet points): Prefer "agreed on"
            to "agreed upon".

            (last paragraph): Leave comma after double quote after "0.95".

  QC page 172:
            IMP: (bottom two complete paragraphs): The comma/period
            after a double quote thing is important here, as these are
            all literal strings whose precise contents are important:
            "Stable", "Unstable", "Development", "Beta", "Scanley
            2.3.0 (RC)", "Scanley 2.3.0 (RC 1)".

            IMP: (last complete paragraph): "gratuitously
            differently", not "gratuitously different".  The second
            word is still an adverb.

  QC page 173:
            IMP: (top of page): Same about commas after double quotes
            for literal strings "3.14.159" and "3.15.anything".

  QC page 176:
            (first paragraph, last line): Leave comma after double
            quote after "0".

  QC page 177:
            (first complete paragraph, thrid line): Leave comma after
            double quote after "3.5.1".

  QC page 179:
            (second paragraph after new header): Leave period after
            double quote after "deciding".

  QC page 180:
            (first complete paragraph, second line): Leave period
            after double quote after "no".

            (first paragraph after new header, third line): No comma
            after "in the end".

  QC page 181:
            (second paragraph after new header): No comma after "in theory".

  QC page 184:
            (middle paragraph, last line): Leave comma after double
            quote after "Scanley 2.5.0", this is a literal string.

  QC page 185:
            (sidebar): Leave comma after double quote after "Tape
            ARchive" [sic].

            (lone line just above middle of page): I added "using zip
            compression" right after "or for Windows" (and before the
            colon), to clarify a distinction.  It's not a big deal if
            that doesn't make it into the print version, but if it
            can, that would be nice.

  QC page 186:
            (second complete paragraph): No comma after "for example".

            (last paragraph, first line): No comma between "is the
            same" and "regardless of".

  QC page 187:
            (sidebar, second paragraph): Leave comma after double
            quote after "ChangeLog".

            (last line of page): Leave commas after double quotes
            after "MySQL 5.0" and "Scanley 2.5.0", these are literal
            strings.

  QC page 188:
            (fifth line of page): No "s" on the end of "use" -- the
            3rd person imperative flavor is deliberate.

  QC page 193:
            (second paragraph): Adding "best" before "interests" is
            unnecessary and changes the meaning very slightly.

  QC page 195:
            (first complete paragraph): No comma after "thrown in".

  QC page 196:
            (third paragraph, last sentence): Instead of removing the
            hyphen from "up-front", it might be better to change the
            word order: "A little up-front discipline on everyone's
            part...".

  QC page 197:
            IMP: (first complete paragraph, second line): Leave comma
            after "friction caused, ...", because omitting it changes
            the meaning to something else.

            (second-to-last line of page): Leave comma after double
            quote after "meeting".
  
* Chapter 8:

  QC page 199:
            (second paragraph): I've always written "grab-bag" with a
            hyphen; for what it's worth the O.E.D. agrees, though as a
            good descriptivist I'd be the first to admit that using
            dictionaries as a source of authority is suspect :-).

            IMP: (second paragraph, fifth line): Reversing the
            possessive apostrophe in "others'" with the period after
            it didn't make sense to me -- are you sure that's what you
            wanted?

            (last two lines of page): Original had "are bought into"
            instead of "have bought into".  This was deliberate; I
            wanted a stative tense instead of an past tense.

  QC page 200:
            (second line): Use "his" instead of "her", to match the
            pronouns used in the next paragraph, whose topic is a
            continuation of this paragraph's topic.  Leave hyphen in
            "horse-trading" (I admit it's a stretch, but the hyphen
            does aid clarity a bit, by clearly separating the compound
            noun from the preceding adjective "outright").

  QC page 201:
            IMP: (first complete paragraph): Leave second-to-last
            sentence as "...whether or not that actually
            helps...", not "...whether or not they actually help...".
            Using "they ... help" changed the meaning.

  QC page 205:
            IMP: (first complete paragraph): Don't add "of" after
            "encouraging more".  That would change the object into a
            mass noun instead of a plain plural.

  QC page 207:
            (third complete paragraph): I left out an article, sorry.
            It should be "a contrib/ area" not "contrib/ areas".

  QC page 208:
            (first paragraph after new header): Since we changed "10"
            to "ten", I changed "20" to "twenty" at the end of the
            same paragraph.

            (middle): Leave comma after double quote after "project manager".

  QC page 209:
            (sidebar, first line): Leave hyphen in "already-fixed", to
            make a firm compound adjective.

  QC page 210:
            (fourth line): Don't add "the ... that ..." to "the fewer
            bugs will survive", it doesn't change the meaning, it just
            sounds fussier (IMHO).

  QC page 212:
            (last paragraph, first line): We could simplify "in terms
            of" to just "at", that would be simpler and more direct.

  QC page 213:
            IMP: (middle paragraph, third-to-last line): Change
            "themselves" to "herself" not "himself", for consistency
            with earlier text.

  QC page 219:
            (second paragraph): I redid the entire last sentence, in
            the XML master.  It now reads: "In many cases, patches
            will overlap with or affect other patches, and need to be
            adjusted with respect to each other before being
            committed."  This is clearer than the original text.

  QC page 220:
            IMP: (second paragraph): Leave comma after "database", and
            don't add a comma between "it" and "looking".  This
            preserves the intended phrase division.

  QC page 221:
            (first complete paragraph): Leave as "immediately on", not
            "immediately upon".  (Maybe I'm secretly British...?)

  QC page 222:
            (second paragraph, fourth-from-last-line): Don't insert
            "with" between "users" and "what".

            (next line): No comma between "case" and "misleads".

  QC page 222:
            (last words of page): Should read "..., and then there
            might or...".  The word "then" was in the original, to
            indicate relative time.

  QC page 223:
            (fourth complete paragraph, last line): Use "her" instead
            of "his", to agree with earlier text.

  QC page 226:
            (first paragraph under new header, last line): Changed
            "them" to "him".

  QC page 227:
            (third line): Leave comma after double quote after "sandbox".
            (fifth line): No comma after "quickly".

  QC page 230:
            (third complete paragraph): Change "whose name is
            recorded" back to "whose name is already recorded".
            It may be redundant, but it is still useful, I think.

  QC page 231:
            (eighth line): Leave as "comment", not "comments" [mass
            noun intentional].

            (second bullet point, last sentence): I changed "go for"
            to "aim for", to be a bit more formal.

  QC page 232:
            (second paragraph after new header, last line): No commas
            around "or all"; "some or all of" is a common idiom.

            (next paragraph, fourth line): Instead of a full stop
            after "territory", let's go back to the original
            "...territory, but...".  This allows both thoughts to be
            part of the same sentence.

* Chapter 9:

  QC page 240:
            (top paragraph): Leave comma after double quote after
            "open source" and "zero cost".

  QC page 241:
            IMP: (definition paragraph under "DFSG-compliant"): No
            comma after "forkability" (having the comma changes the
            sense of the phrase to a surprising degree).

  QC page 247:
            (last paragraph): Leave comma after double quote after "free".

  QC page 248:
            (first complete paragraph): Leave period after double
            quote after "free".

            (quoted text near bottom of page): Spell "acknowledgement"
            with an "e", as this is a quote and that's how they spell it.

  QC page 250:
            (first paragraph): "bona fide" is both boldface and
            italicized; shouldn't it be italicized only?

  QC page 252:
            IMP: (first paragraph): No comma after "at the very
            worst", putting a comma there changes the directionality
            of that phrase.

  QC page 254:
            (fourth-to-last line on page): No comma after "in the end".
  
* Appendix A:

  QC page 258:
            (entry for "monotone"): I'm okay with taking Andy's advice
            and removing the "[sic]" from the end of this entry.

  QC page 260:
            (entry for "CVSNT"): The URL at the end is missing a
            trailing slash.
  
* Appendix B:

  QC page 265:
            (first paragraph, first line): Not sure how "s" got on the
            end of "bug trackers" here, it's not that way in the XML
            master.  Should be singular "bug tracker".

  QC page 266:
            (entry for "Trac"): I rewrote the second sentence
            like this: "It uses wiki linking to connect issues, files,
            version control changesets, and plain wiki pages."
  
* Appendix C:

  QC page 269:
            IMP: (second paragraph, second sentence): Remove the
            phrase "in its entirety", for reasons that will become
            clear below.

  QC page 273:
            IMP: (first line): Change "Brett Glass" to "[omitted]".
            We don't want to preserve Kamp's condemnation of Brett
            Glass in print for all time.  However, this omits some
            text from the post, hence the change on page 269 above. 

  QC page 274:
            IMP: There were TAB characters in the original source,
            that's why the ascii vertical lines along the edges got
            messed up.  They should be straight lines, not ragged, of
            course.  See http://www.bikeshed.com/ (scroll down to the
            second half) to see how it should look.

  QC page 275:
            Same as page 274.

  page 276 QC page :
            IMP: (third line): Replaced "Brett Glasses" with
            "[omitted]s", see above note about page 273 for why.
