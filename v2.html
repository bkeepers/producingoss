<p>In early 2013, I ran a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kfogel/updating-producing-open-source-software-for-2nd-ed" >Kickstarter campaign</a> to raise money to enable me to revise this book, which badly needed updating after seven years.  The campaign was successful, raising USD $15,000&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;thank you, everyone!&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and I began work on the revisions in March 2013.  See the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kfogel/updating-producing-open-source-software-for-2nd-ed/posts" >project updates</a> at Kickstarter for progress reports.  Throughout the book, sections under construction or revision are marked with the special string "poss2".  Below is my explanation from the Kickstarter campaign about why I felt it was time to update the book:</p>

<blockquote style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 110%;">
<p>It's time to update my 2005 book "Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project". Help me do it right.</p>

<p>In 2005 I wrote a book called <a href="/" >Producing Open Source Software</a>, about the human side of running free software / open source projects.  It was published by <a href="http://oreilly.com/" >O'Reilly Media</a>, and simultaneously released online under a free license.   It's been pretty successful, at least in the ways I'd hoped: it's cited frequently by people I respect, it even sells decently, and I get plenty of constructive bug reports (my favorite measure of success).  It's also been <a href="/translations.html" >translated</a> into many languages, often by volunteer translators or translation teams.</p>

<p>But 2005 is a long time ago.  The world of free and open source software is changing -- technically, culturally, even legally -- and the book really needs to be updated after seven and a half years.  To give you an idea: <a href="http://github.com/" >GitHub</a> didn't even exist when the first edition came out!</p>

<p>I've been doing a lot of open source consulting since the first edition was published -- consulting about open source processes, how to launch and run projects, etc -- with a wide variety of clients: governments, for-profit companies, non-profits, and individual developers.  I've also been talking to people in many different open source projects.  Along the way, I kept thinking that I'd love to incorporate the things I'd learned into a second edition.  Eventually, I realized that the way to find time to do it was to treat the book like a client -- hence this Kickstarter campaign.</p>

<p>The second edition, like the first, will be published by O'Reilly Media, and will be under the same <a href="/en/copyright.html" >free license</a>.</p>
