== Next release

- Created the fork. The link:http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/producingoss/trunk@2800[last change] in the link:http://producingoss.com/vc.html[original subversion repository] was by @kfogel on April 5, 2015.

    git svn checkout http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/producingoss/trunk/

- Removed translations. Maintaining translations will be incredibly inefficient as content initially evolves a lot. Translations will be managed as forks.

- Converted english translation to link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc], and the original build pipeline was replaced with link:http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]. (link:https://github.com/bkeepers/producingoss/pull/2[#2])
