Karl,

Very interesting and though provoking so far. Am really engrossed reading it.

#1) Quoteable quote from Stefano if you want to use it.

    "good ideas and bad code build communities, the other three combinations do not"
    (http://www.mail-archive.com/general@incubator.apache.org/msg00099.html)
    
#2) Am half way thru...is there any place you cover things like "what to
    do when the BigCo withdraws support for the project that you are
    involved in"...Happened with us in Apache Axis
    
#3) How do you prevent forks? Should you? For example, JBoss forked Axis
    w/o giving back a single line of code. IBM did the same but at least
    they had half-a-dozen folks working for some period of time before
    withdrawing support. 
    
#4) Danese is no longer with SUN. She's with Intel (Page 68)
 
#5) Page 12, choosing a good name. may be it makes sense to point to 
    nameprotect.com, where one can search for trademarked names?
    
#6) Page 5/6 - "Accidental Resistance" May be a few lines about Apache 
	would be appropriate?
	
#7) Page 95, "No conversations in the Bug Tracker". Should folks redirect
    bug notifications to the developer mailing list? Will help in everyone
    getting a peek at the problems getting reported and will help catch
    conversations happening in Bug Tracker (as folks will notice 
    immediately and can stop it from happening)

#8) Page 115, where there is a reference to configure/make. Is it worth
    mentioning about Ant and Maven usage in java projects?
    
#9) Do you want to cover "Continuous Integration" (making sure that 
    your software is still in sync with other dependencies that you use)
    For example, Apache Gump builds 500+ java projects in the order of
    their dependencies and even runs the unit/system tests.
