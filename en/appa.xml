<title>Canned Hosting Sites</title>

<simplesect>

<para>In earlier editions of this book, before 2015, I maintained a
list of credible, well-established canned hosting sites.  I've stopped
maintaining a complete list, as it's too easy for it to become out of
date.  The most important such sites&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;which are also
the ones likely to be around for a long time&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;are
discussed in <xref linkend="canned-hosting"/> anyway, and a more
complete list is available at <ulink

>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities</ulink>.</para>
