<appendix id="bug-reporting">
<title>Obsolete Appendix (was: Example Instructions for Reporting Bugs)</title>

<simplesect>

<para>This appendix used to contain a lightly-edited copy of the
Subversion project's online instructions to new users on how to report
bugs.  They're still good instructions, and are referenced from <xref
linkend="users-to-participants"/><phrase output="printed"> in <xref
linkend="managing-participants"/></phrase>.  But as they are a living
document, I felt it didn't make sense to include a frozen snaphot of
them here, and so no longer maintain a copy in this appendix.  You can
view them at <ulink
url="http://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html"
>subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html</ulink>.</para>
