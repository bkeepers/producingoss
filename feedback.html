<p>I'm trying to reduce the likelihood of spam address harvesters
learning about that email address; on this page it is encoded in
various ways to <a
href="http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml">fool the
harvesters</a>.  To give someone an address for book feedback, just
point them to this page's URL: <a
href="http://producingoss.com/feedback.html"
>http://producingoss.com/feedback.html</a>.</p>

<p>The above email address goes straight to the author.  If this book
were a full-fledged open source project, there would be an open
mailing list with web-accessible archives (among <a
href="http://producingoss.com/html-chunk/technical-infrastructure.html"
>other things</a>).  However, the book stands somewhere between a
single-author work and a collaborative project, and its supporting
infrastructure is designed mainly to make things easy for the primary
maintainer.</p>
