<para><remark>Thanking everybody for everything is boring and
information-free; save the gratitude for the unexpected or impressive
stuff.  Always avoid commit-counting, and debunk it quickly if someone
else starts doing it (story of Steinmetz and the mark here).  In
general, there is always a tension between making sure that people's
individual contributions are recognized, and making the project be a
group effort rather than a collection of individual glories (hmmm,
that thought ought perhaps go at the start of this
chapter).</remark></para>
