<title>Por quê escrever este livro?</title>

<para>Nas festas que participo agora, as pessoas nao mais fazem
uma cara de espanto quando eu digo que desenvolvo software livre.
"Ah sim, software livre&mdash;como o Linux?" elas dizem. Prontamente
respondo: "Sim, exatamente! É isto que eu faço."
É bom não me sentir mais completamente um estranho. No passado, a próxima
questão era altamente previsível: "Como você ganha dinheiro com
isto?". Para responder, eu resumia a economia do código aberto:
que existem organizações as quais os interesses são de que certos
software existam, mas eles não precisam vender cópias, eles somente
precisam ter certeza de que o software está disponível e sendo 
mantido, como uma ferramenta, não como uma mercadoria.</para>

<para>Ultimamente, entretanto, a pergunta seguinte não tem sempre sido sobre
dinheiro. O modelo de negócios para Software Livre e de Código
Aberto<footnote><para>Os termos "Código Aberto" e "Livre", neste contexto,
são essencialmente sinônimos. Eles são discutidos em mais detalhes em 
<xref linkend="free-vs-open-source"/><phrase output="printed"> na
<xref linkend="introdução"/></phrase>.</para></footnote> não é mais tão
misterioso e muitos não-programadores já entendem ou, pelo menos, não se
surpreendem em ver gente empregada em tempo integral com isto. Ao invés
disto, a pergunta que eu tenho ouvido com mais frequência é "<emphasis>Uau,
como isto dá certo ?</emphasis>"</para>

<para>Eu não tinha uma resposta satisfatória pronta e cada vez que eu me
empenhava mais em produzir uma, mais eu percebia a complexidade deste
assunto. Tocar um projeto de Software Livre não é exatamente como
gerenciar um negócio (imagine ter que negociar constantemente sobre a
natureza do seu produto com um grupo de voluntários, a maioria dos quais
você nunca encontrou pessoalmente!). Tambem não é, por diversos motivos,
o mesmo que manter uma organização sem fins lucrativos, nem um governo. Há
similaridades com todas estas coisas mas eu cheguei lentamente à conclusão
de que Software Livre é <foreingnphrase>sui generis</foreingphrase>. Há
várias coisas com as quais isto pode ser eficientemente comparado mas
nenhuma com a qual possa ser equiparado. De fato, o simples fato de se
assumir que projetos de Software Livre possam ser "tocados" é uma falácia.
Um projeto de Software Livre pode ser <emphasis>iniciado</emphasis> e ser
influenciado por interessados, frequentemente de forma bastante forte. Mas
seus resultados não podem ser transformados em propriedade de nenhum único
dono e, enquanto houver gente em algum lugar, &mdash;qualquer lugar&mdash;,
interessada em dar continuidade, ele não poderá ser encerrado
unilateralmente. Todos tem poder infinito, ninguém tem força. Isto gera uma
dinâmica interessante.</para>

<para>Este foi o motivo pelo qual eu quis escrever este livro. Projetos de
Software Livre evoluiram uma cultura distinta, uma moral na qual a liberdade
de fazer o software realizar qualquer coisa que se deseje é o foco e ainda
assim o resultado desta liberdade não é uma dispersão de indivíduos cada
um indo em direções separadas com o código mas sim uma entusiasmada
colaboração. De fato, competencia na própria colaboração é uma das mais
valiosas habilidades em Software Livre. Gerenciar estes projetos é como se
engajar em uma espécie de cooperação hipertrofiada, onde a habilidade não só
de trabalhar com outros mas de produzir novas formas de colaboração, podem
resultar em benefícios tangíveis para o software. Este livro tenta descrever
as técnicas pelas quais isto pode ser feito. Ele não é de forma nenhuma
completo mas é pelo menos um início.</para>

<para>Software Livre de qualidade é uma meta valiosa por si só e eu espero
que leitores que procurem meios de se obter isto, se satisfaçam com o que
encontrarão aqui. Mas, além disto, eu espero também transmitir algo sobre o
puro prazer de se ter em trabalhar com uma equipe motivada de
desenvolvedores de Código Aberto e em interagir com usuários na forma
maravilhosamente direta que o Código Aberto promove. Participar de um
projeto de sucesso de Software Livre é <emphasis>divertido</emphasis> e, em
última instância, o que mantém o sistema todo funcionando.</para>

<title>Who Should Read This Book?</title>

<para>This book is meant for software developers and managers who are
considering starting an open source project, or who have started one
and are wondering what to do now.  It should also be helpful for
people who just want to participate in an open source project but have
never done so before.</para>

<para>The reader need not be a programmer, but should know basic
software engineering concepts such as source code, compilers, and
patches.</para>

<para>Prior experience with open source software, as either a user or
a developer, is not necessary.  Those who have worked in free software
projects before will probably find at least some parts of the book a
bit obvious, and may want to skip those sections.  Because there's
such a potentially wide range of audience experience, I've made an
effort to label sections clearly, and to say when something can be
skipped by those already familiar with the material.</para>

</sect1>

<!-- ======================== SECTION ============================== -->
<sect1 id="sources">
<title>Sources</title>

<para>Much of the raw material for this book came from five years of
working with the Subversion project
(<ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org/"/>).  Subversion is an open
source version control system, written from scratch, and intended to
replace CVS as the <foreignphrase>de facto</foreignphrase> version
control system of choice in the open source community.  The project
was started by my employer, CollabNet
(<ulink url="http://www.collab.net/"/>), in early 2000, and thank
goodness CollabNet understood right from the start how to run it as a
truly collaborative, distributed effort.  We got a lot of volunteer
developer buy-in early on; today there are 50-some developers on
the project, of whom only a few are CollabNet employees.</para>

<para>Subversion is in many ways a classic example of an open source
project, and I ended up drawing on it more heavily than I originally
expected.  This was partly a matter of convenience: whenever I needed
an example of a particular phenomenon, I could usually call one up
from Subversion right off the top of my head.  But it was also a
matter of verification.  Although I am involved in other free software
projects to varying degrees, and talk to friends and acquaintances
involved in many more, one quickly realizes when writing for print
that all assertions need to be fact-checked.  I didn't want to make
statements about events in other projects based only on what I could
read in their public mailing list archives.  If someone were to try
that with Subversion, I knew, she'd be right about half the time and
wrong the other half.  So when drawing inspiration or examples from a
project with which I didn't have direct experience, I tried to first
talk to an informant there, someone I could trust to explain what was
really going on.</para>

<para>Subversion has been my job for the last 5 years, but I've been
involved in free software for 12.  Other projects that influenced this
book include:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>The GNU Emacs text editor project at the Free
            Software Foundation, in which I maintain a few small
            packages.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>Concurrent Versions System (CVS), which I worked on
            intensely in 1994&ndash;1995 with Jim Blandy, but have been
            involved with only intermittently since.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>The collection of open source projects known as the
            Apache Software Foundation, especially the Apache Portable
            Runtime (APR) and Apache HTTP Server.</para> 
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>OpenOffice.org, the Berkeley Database from
            Sleepycat, and MySQL Database; I have not been
            involved with these projects personally, but have observed
            them and, in some cases, talked to people there.</para> 
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>GNU Debugger (GDB) (likewise).</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>The Debian Project (likewise).</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>This is not a complete list, of course.  Like most open source
programmers, I keep loose tabs on many different projects, just to
have a sense of the general state of things.  I won't name all of them
here, but they are mentioned in the text where appropriate.</para>

<title>Acknowledgments</title>

<para>This book took four times longer to write than I thought it
would, and for much of that time felt rather like a grand piano
suspended above my head wherever I went.  Without help from many
people, I would not have been able to complete it while staying
sane.</para>

<para>Andy Oram, my editor at O'Reilly, was a writer's dream.  Aside
from knowing the field intimately (he suggested many of the topics),
he has the rare gift of knowing what one meant to say and helping one
find the right way to say it.  It has been an honor to work with him.
Thanks also to Chuck Toporek for steering this proposal to Andy right
away.</para>

<para>Brian Fitzpatrick reviewed almost all of the material as I wrote
it, which not only made the book better, but kept me writing when I
wanted to be anywhere in the world but in front of the computer.  Ben
Collins-Sussman and Mike Pilato also checked up on progress, and were
always happy to discuss&mdash;sometimes at length&mdash;whatever topic
I was trying to cover that week.  They also noticed when I slowed
down, and gently nagged when necessary.  Thanks, guys.</para>

<para>Biella Coleman was writing her dissertation at the same time
I was writing this book.  She knows what it means to sit down and
write every day, and provided an inspiring example as well as a
sympathetic ear.  She also has a fascinating anthropologist's-eye view
of the free software movement, giving both ideas and references that I
was able use in the book.  Alex Golub&mdash;another anthropologist
with one foot in the free software world, and also finishing his
dissertation at the same time&mdash;was exceptionally supportive early
on, which helped a great deal.</para>

<para>Micah Anderson somehow never seemed too oppressed by his own
writing gig, which was inspiring in a sick, envy-generating sort of
way, but he was ever ready with friendship, conversation, and (on at
least one occasion) technical support.  Thanks, Micah!</para>

<para>Jon Trowbridge and Sander Striker gave both encouragement and
concrete help&mdash;their broad experience in free software provided
material I couldn't have gotten any other way.</para>

<para>Thanks to Greg Stein not only for friendship and well-timed
encouragement, but for showing the Subversion project how important
regular code review is in building a programming community.  Thanks
also to Brian Behlendorf, who tactfully drummed into our heads the
importance of having discussions publicly; I hope that principle is
reflected throughout this book.</para>

<para>Thanks to Benjamin "Mako" Hill and Seth Schoen, for various
conversations about free software and its politics; to Zack Urlocker
and Louis Suarez-Potts for taking time out of their busy schedules to
be interviewed; to Shane on the Slashcode list for allowing his post
to be quoted; and to Haggen So for his enormously helpful comparison
of canned hosting sites.</para>

<para>Thanks to Alla Dekhtyar, Polina, and Sonya for their unflagging
and patient encouragement.  I'm very glad that I will no longer have
to end (or rather, try unsuccessfully to end) our evenings early to go
home and work on "The Book."</para>

<para>Thanks to Jack Repenning for friendship, conversation, and a
stubborn refusal to ever accept an easy wrong analysis when a harder
right one is available.  I hope that some of his long experience with
both software development and the software industry rubbed off on this
book.</para>

<para>CollabNet was exceptionally generous in allowing me a flexible
schedule to write, and didn't complain when it went on far longer than
originally planned.  I don't know all the intricacies of how
management arrives at such decisions, but I suspect Sandhya Klute, and
later Mahesh Murthy, had something to do with it&mdash;my thanks to
them both.</para>

<para>The entire Subversion development team has been an inspiration
for the past five years, and much of what is in this book I learned
from working with them.  I won't thank them all by name here, because
there are too many, but I implore any reader who runs into a
Subversion committer to immediately buy that committer the drink of
his choice&mdash;I certainly plan to.</para>

<para>Many times I ranted to Rachel Scollon about the state of the
book; she was always willing to listen, and somehow managed to make
the problems seem smaller than before we talked.  That helped a
lot&mdash;thanks.</para>

<para>Thanks (again) to Noel Taylor, who must surely have wondered why
I wanted to write another book given how much I complained the last
time, but whose friendship and leadership of Golos&aacute; helped keep
music and good fellowship in my life even in the busiest times.
Thanks also to Matthew Dean and Dorothea Samtleben, friends and
long-suffering musical partners, who were very understanding as my
excuses for not practicing piled up.  Megan Jennings was constantly
supportive, and genuinely interested in the topic even though it was
unfamiliar to her&mdash;a great tonic for an insecure writer.  Thanks,
pal!</para>

<para>I had four knowledgeable and diligent reviewers for this book:
Yoav Shapira, Andrew Stellman, Davanum Srinivas, and Ben Hyde.  If I
had been able to incorporate all of their excellent suggestions, this
would be a better book.  As it was, time constraints forced me to pick
and choose, but the improvements were still significant.  Any errors
that remain are entirely my own.</para>

<para>My parents, Frances and Henry, were wonderfully supportive as
always, and as this book is less technical than the previous one, I
hope they'll find it somewhat more readable.</para>

<para>Finally, I would like to thank the dedicatees, Karen Underhill
and Jim Blandy.  Karen's friendship and understanding have meant
everything to me, not only during the writing of this book but for the
last seven years.  I simply would not have finished without her help.
Likewise for Jim, a true friend and a hacker's hacker, who first
taught me about free software, much as a bird might teach an airplane
about flying.</para>
