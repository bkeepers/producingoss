* What is rude / not rude in the free software world?
    - technical criticism is a form of flattery
    - unadorned questions are less often rhetorical or mocking
    - accusing someone of a certain "tone" without concrete examples
    - not taking time to *provide* concrete examples, and not
      acknowledging that one has not taken the time.

* Footnote the word "culture" with a note that academic anthropologists 
  (like Biella Coleman <http://www.healthhacker.com/biella/>) study it.

* Bruno Latour: "Aramis"!
