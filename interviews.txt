    [status: not asked yet, will see him Wednesday Dec. 8th, though]

Questions/Topics to start off the discussion:

  * What is the business model, or business models, by which open
    source is seen as a worthwhile investment?  Some models are:

      + Dual-licensing (but how do they handle contributed code?)
      + Service sales
      + Hardware sales
      + Undercut a competitor
      + Internal infrastructure dependence
      + What else?

  * Did you start the project(s), or did you join an existing project?

  * How in general would you characterize the relationship between
    the corporation and the volunteer community?  Harmonious?
    Divisive?  Some of both?

  * What is the ratio between salaried and non-salaried developers?
    (But make sure not to compare apples with oranges.)

    What about _contribution_ ratios?  Do equally large and complex
    contributions come from all sources?

  * Do you have competitors paying their own developers on the same
    projects?  Do you sense divided loyalties -- from them or from
    your own people?

  * Have you ever had serious disagreement on the technical direction
    of the project between influential dev community people and the
    company?  How was it resolved?

  * Did you ever face a serious fork threat?  Cause one?  Did a fork
    actually happen?

  * How much of the corporation's OSS strategy is made public?  To
    what degree does the dev community think of itself as part of
    that strategy?

  * Curiosity: Have a corporate position on software patents?

  * Internal resistance/reservations about open source involvement?
    (Understandable if can't answer fully, though.)

  * How integrated are non-developmental resources integrated with
    the public project?  Say, the QA team, or the documentation team?
