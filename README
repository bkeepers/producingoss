This directory contains the master sources for the book

               "Producing Open Source Software:
         How to Run a Successful Free Software Project"

by Karl Fogel.  You may have received this file as part of a static
package (e.g., producingoss-xml.tar.gz), or perhaps you checked out
the book from version control (see http://producingoss.com/vc.html).
Either way, the XML files here can be used to generate PostScript,
PDF, HTML, or other formats more suitable for readers.  These XML
files use the Docbook Lite DTD (a scaled-down version of Docbook;
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook), from O'Reilly Media.
This document tells how to compile the sources into other formats.

Docbook
-------

  Docbook has a tortured, confusing history.  Before you do anything,
  take a look at Eric Raymond's excellent "Docbook Demystification HOWTO":

     http://tldp.org/HOWTO/DocBook-Demystification-HOWTO/

  It's very short and clears up many things.

Compiling
---------

1. To build this book from source, you need a working Ruby installation with
   [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed. Then, run:

      $ script/bootstrap

2. To build the HTML, Epub, Mobi, and PDF formats, run:

      $ script/build
