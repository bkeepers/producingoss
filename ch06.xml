<title> Avoiding Common Pitfalls </title>

<para> Avoiding common pitfalls; distinguishing productive threads
from unproductive ones; guiding threads toward usefulness without
being pushy.  </para>

<sect1 id="pfs-ch-6-sect-3">
<title>Conspicuous Use of Archives</title>

<para><remark>The importance of having all communications be logged
and be searchable, with stable references.  Describe the misery that
results when this is not available -- for example, the pain of the
contactor.se/~dast "route around" that resulted from the lossage of
the native tigris.org mail archiver.  Written guidelines vs precedence
is like the distinction between English statutory law and common law.
Good archiving is essential for the same reason.  It's like an oral
tradition with a video camera constantly running.</remark></para>

<para>Perfect example: a named anchor for *every* FAQ item.</para>

<remark>(Also, get Brian B's story of the FreeBSD IRC archives
here.)</remark>

<sect1 id="pfs-ch-6-sect-5">
<title> Internal vs External Communications </title>

<para> Internal vs external communications.  In free software
projects, there tends to be a smooth continuum between purely internal
discussions and public relations statements.  Discuss how to navigate
this continuum.  Describe how to hook into the standard real-time news
distribution forums (RSS, CIA, etc), and the meta-distribution sites
such as Freshmeat.  </para>

<!-- This used to be in Chapter 2.  It's not really about
     communications either, but where is a better place?  Should it
     be cut entirely? 

   Understanding potential volunteers' motivations will help you set
   things up to attract them.  You can't build the lamp until you know
   what frequencies of light the moths are attracted to.  Oh, wait,
   maybe that's not such a good metaphor...

   For example, talk about the sharp distinction between those who
   were interested in reaching 1.0 versus those who were interested in
   adding new features to Subversion.  (Philip, Ghudson, etc.)
