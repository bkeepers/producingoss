German translators goals
========================
Add a paragraph and say what you are doing -
Don't make your cotranslators guess it!

peu:
* bootstrapping the a convergent translation process
  * re-embed the commented-out original text on a per-section basis
    (see ja/* for example) changes in the English version can be diffed
  * check and update translation section per section (todo: howto track this)
    (my personal goal: maximum readability and understandability 
    as close as possible to the English version)
