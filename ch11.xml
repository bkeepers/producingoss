<title>The Consent Of The Governed. [ 5-8 pp ]</title>

<simplesect>

<para> What leadership means when you have no control over people
        you've never met :-).  A summing up of which techniques work in
        this environment and which don't, and a list of the principles
        by which one's actions should appear to be governed.  (The
        phrasing is deliberate, apologies to Niccolo Machiavelli.)
