<title>Preface</title>
  
<simplesect>
    
<para>At cocktail parties, people no longer give me blank looks when I
tell them I write free software.  "Oh, yes, Open Source &mdash; like
Linux and all that stuff?" they say.  I nod eagerly in agreement.  The
terms <emphasis>free software</emphasis> and <emphasis>open
source</emphasis> are largely interchangeable, though the latter seems
to be in wider use among non-programmers.  "Yes, exactly!  That's what
we work on," I say.  </para>

<para>Over the last couple of decades, Free Software has gone from
being an obscure, mostly unfunded sideline in the software development
world, to a [todo]... but, although people now know what it
<emphasis>is</emphasis>, they don't know how it works.  The most
common questions are: "But how do you get paid?" and "Who makes the
decisions in these projects?".

<para><remark>Not done yet.  (Sorry, Andy, should have left you a
visible comment before that the preface was still in progress.  It's
the sort of thing that can be finished quickly, and is better
completed after the book itself is done anyway.)</remark></para>

<!-- ======================== SECTION 1 ============================== -->
<sect1 id="pfs-ch-0-sect-1">
<title>Who Should Read This Book?</title>

<para><remark>Describe target audience(s), and assumed reader
background.  (As in, the reader should know what the terms "source
code" and "commit" mean, even if doesn't write code, etc.)  Also:
explain that to an experienced free software programmer, much of this
book will seem obvious, trite, and boring.  Point out how wide the gap
is and how you don't need the bridge if you're already on the other
side.</remark></para>

</sect1>


<!-- ======================== SECTION 2 ============================== -->
<sect1 id="pfs-ch-0-sect-2">
<title>Terminology</title>

<para><remark>Explain very briefly how the two terms FS and OSS are
synonymous, though different in emphasis; talk about how people got
confused by "free", mention the open source consortium.  Point out
that the term "open source" gives the useful contrasting term "closed
source", which is much more descriptive than "non-free".  But this
initial mention of FS/OSS terminology should be very short, only a
paragraph or so.  Leave the rest for the History section in Chapter 1,
<xref linkend="pfs-ch-1-sect-1"/>.</remark></para>

<para><remark>Andy's note about this bit said: "Keep the discussion
of free and open source to one or two sentences.  Basically, say they
refer to pretty much the same software but stress different aspects
of the movement.  Then refer readers to Chapter 1."  Agreed.  Am
leaving this tweak for later, because the style and density of the
one or two sentences here will depend partly on what's to
come.</remark></para>

<para><remark>Anamoly: "closed-source" is almost always hyphenated,
"open source" is not.  Dunno why this is, but at least it should be
acknowledged.  Also, note how "commercial" is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
being used as an antonym for "free / open source" here: plenty of free
software projects are commercial in intent.  The important difference
is proprietary vs non-proprietary, not commercial vs
non-commercial.</remark></para>

<!-- ======================== SECTION 3 ============================== -->
<sect1 id="pfs-ch-0-sect-3">
<title>Conventions Used in This Book</title>

<para><remark>(O'Reilly probably has boilerplate for this
section.)</remark></para>

<sect2 id="pfs-ch-0-sect-3.1">
<title>Typographic Conventions</title>

<para><remark>Andy says: "Copy and amend bolerplate from another
book."  Will do.</remark></para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="pfs-ch-0-sect-3.2">
<title>Sourcing Conventions</title>

<para><remark>Might want to note why a URL is sometimes given and
sometimes not.  Basically, it's a matter of convenience.  When
offering a quote, for example, it's best to give the actual web page.
But a mention of a project may or may not call for a URL, depending on
the context.  The general principle is that if the obvious Google
search would quickly lead to the item in question, then there's no
point giving the URL, unless it would be very easy &amp; unobtrusive
to do so.</remark></para>
