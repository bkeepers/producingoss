Fewer than ten percent of free software projects take hold and achieve
lasting success. Read this book to improve your chances of joining
this fortunate crowd.

<em>Producing Free Software</em>, written by the long-time developer
and manager Karl Fogel, can appeal to many types of people doing
software development.  Perhaps you are a programmer whose small
project has become successful and needs to grow. Or you have a project
that grew to the point where you're having trouble managing
it. Perhaps you have trouble motivating contributors, or are
experiencing a lot of churn. Maybe you inherited a project and are
wondering how to keep it going. Or have a proprietary project you'd
like to make open.

Fogel has seen projects in many stages of development, and has
consulted with and collaborated with leading development teams on many
free software projects. Among his experience is becoming an official
maintainer of CVS, managing the creation of Subversion for CollabNet,
Inc., contributing packages to the Emacs project, and doing
documentation on several projects.

Topics in <em>Producing Free Software</em> include:

* Resources provided to developers and users by a successful free
  software project

* Keeping developers productive, cooperative, and happy

* Handling communications efficiently

* Distributing responsibility for bug tracking and fixing

* Ways to fund a project

* Testing and releasing
