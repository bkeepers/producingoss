== Canned Hosting Sites

In earlier editions of this book, before 2015, I maintained a list of
credible, well-established canned hosting sites. I've stopped
maintaining a complete list, as it's too easy for it to become out of
date. The most important such sites — which are also the ones likely to
be around for a long time — are discussed in link:#canned-hosting[???]
anyway, and a more complete list is available at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities].
