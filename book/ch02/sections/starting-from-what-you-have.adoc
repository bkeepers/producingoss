=== Starting From What You Have

You've looked around, found that nothing out there really fits your
needs, and decided to start a new project.

What now?

The hardest part about launching a free software project is transforming
a private vision into a public one. You or your organization may know
perfectly well what you want, but expressing that goal comprehensibly to
the world is a fair amount of work. It is essential, however, that you
take the time to do it. You and the other founders must decide what the
project is really about—that is, decide its limitations, what it _won't_
do as well as what it will—and write up a mission statement. This part
is usually not too hard, though it can sometimes reveal unspoken
assumptions and even disagreements about the nature of the project,
which is fine: better to resolve those now than later. The next step is
to package up the project for public consumption, and this is,
basically, pure drudgery.

What makes it so laborious is that it consists mainly of organizing and
documenting things everyone already knows—"everyone", that is, who's
been involved in the project so far. Thus, for the people doing the
work, there is no immediate benefit. They do not need a `README` file
giving an overview of the project, nor a design document. They do not
need a carefully arranged code tree conforming to the informal but
widespread standards of software source distributions. Whatever way the
source code is arranged is fine for them, because they're already
accustomed to it anyway, and if the code runs at all, they know how to
use it. It doesn't even matter, for them, if the fundamental
architectural assumptions of the project remain undocumented; they're
already familiar with that too.

Newcomers, on the other hand, need all these things. Fortunately, they
don't need them all at once. It's not necessary for you to provide every
possible resource before taking a project public. In a perfect world,
perhaps, every new open source project would start out life with a
thorough design document, a complete user manual (with special markings
for features planned but not yet implemented), beautifully and portably
packaged code, capable of running on any computing platform, and so on.
In reality, taking care of all these loose ends would be prohibitively
time-consuming, and anyway, it's work that one can reasonably hope
others will help with once the project is under way.

What _is_ necessary, however, is that enough investment be put into
presentation that newcomers can get past the initial obstacle of
unfamiliarity. Think of it as the first step in a bootstrapping process,
to bring the project to a kind of minimum activation energy. I've heard
this threshold called the hacktivation energy: the amount of energy a
newcomer must put in before she starts getting something back. The lower
a project's hacktivation energy, the better. Your first task is bring
the hacktivation energy down to a level that encourages people to get
involved.

Each of the following subsections describes one important aspect of
starting a new project. They are presented roughly in the order that a
new visitor would encounter them, though of course the order in which
you actually implement them might be different. You can treat them as a
checklist. When starting a project, just go down the list and make sure
you've got each item covered, or at least that you're comfortable with
the potential consequences if you've left one out.
