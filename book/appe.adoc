[[bug-reporting]]
== Obsolete Appendix (was: Example Instructions for Reporting Bugs)

This appendix used to contain a lightly-edited copy of the Subversion
project's online instructions to new users on how to report bugs.
They're still good instructions, and are referenced from
link:#users-to-volunteers[???]in link:#managing-volunteers[???]. But as
they are a living document, I felt it didn't make sense to include a
frozen snaphot of them here, and so no longer maintain a copy in this
appendix. You can view them at
http://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html[subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html].
