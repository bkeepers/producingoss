== Obsolete Appendix (was: Free Version Control Systems)

I used to maintain here a list of all the free software version control
systems I knew anything about, with comments about some of them. While
there is still experimentation in open source version control systems,
at least for now we appear to have settled on a few standards:
http://git-scm.com[Git], primarily, and somewhat more rarely
http://mercurial.selenic.com/[Mercurial] and sometimes
http://subversion.tigris.org/[Subversion]. My thoughts on which to
choose for your project are already given in link:#vc-choosing[???], and
it's not sustainable for me to maintain an increasingly out-of-date list
of other version control systems that you are unlikely to use anyway. If
you want a list, though,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revision_control_software[] is a
good place to start.
