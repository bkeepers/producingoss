[[bug-trackers]]
== Obsolete Appendix (was: Free Bug Trackers)

I used to maintain here a list of all the open source bug trackers I
knew anything about, with comments on some of them. Bug trackers are
still an active area of development and experimentation, perhaps even
more so than version control systems (see link:#vc-systems[???]), and
I've found it increasingly unsustainable to maintain an appendix that
stays up-to-date with the field. While I have personal preferences — I
particularly like http://www.redmine.org/[Redmine] — the important thing
is that whatever tracker you choose, it have the features needed to
support an active open source community; those features are discussed in
detail in link:#bug-tracker[???].

For lists of bug trackers and comparisons between them, try

Comparison of Issue Tracking Systems].
