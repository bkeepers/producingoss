<title>Technical Infrastructure</title>

<simplesect>

<para>Free software projects rely on technologies that support the
selective capture and integration of information.  The more skilled
you are at using these technologies, and at persuading others to use
them, the more successful your project will be.  This only becomes
more true as the project grows.  Good information management is what
prevents open source projects from collapsing under the weight of
Brooks' Law<footnote><para>From his book <citetitle>The Mythical Man
Month</citetitle>, 1975.  See <ulink
url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month"/> and <ulink
url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Law"/>.</para></footnote>,
which states that adding manpower to a late software project makes it
later.  Fred Brooks observed that the complexity of a project
increases as the <emphasis>square</emphasis> of the number of
participants.  When only a few people are involved, everyone can easily
talk to everyone else, but when hundreds of people are involved, it is
no longer possible for each person to remain constantly aware of what
everyone else is doing.  If good free software project management is
about making everyone feel like they're all working together in the
same room, the obvious question is: what happens when everyone in a
crowded room tries to talk at once?</para>

<para>This problem is not new.  In non-metaphorical crowded rooms, the
solution is <firstterm>parliamentary procedure</firstterm>: formal
guidelines for how to have real-time discussions in large groups, how
to make sure important dissents are not lost in floods of "me-too"
comments, how to form subcommittees, how to recognize when decisions
are made, etc.  An important part of parliamentary procedure is
specifying how the group interacts with its information management
system.  Some remarks are made "for the record", others are not.  The
record itself is subject to direct manipulation, and is understood to
be not a literal transcript of what occurred, but a representation of
what the group is willing to <emphasis>agree</emphasis> occurred.  The
record is not monolithic, but takes different forms for different
purposes.  It comprises the minutes of individual meetings, the
complete collection of all minutes of all meetings, summaries, agendas
and their annotations, committee reports, reports from correspondents
not present, lists of action items, etc.</para>

<para>Because the Internet is not really a room, we don't have to
worry about replicating those parts of parliamentary procedure that
keep some people quiet while others are speaking.  But when it comes
to information management techniques, well-run open source projects
are parliamentary procedure on steroids.  Since almost all
communication in open source projects happens in writing, elaborate
systems have evolved for routing and labeling data appropriately; for
minimizing repetitions so as to avoid spurious divergences; for
storing and retrieving data; for correcting bad or obsolete
information; and for associating disparate bits of information with
each other as new connections are observed.  Active participants in
open source projects internalize many of these techniques, and will
often perform complex manual tasks to ensure that information is
routed correctly.  But the whole endeavor ultimately depends on
sophisticated software support.  As much as possible, the
communications media themselves should do the routing, labeling, and
recording, and should make the information available to humans in the
most convenient way possible.  In practice, of course, humans will
still need to intervene at many points in the process, and it's
important that the software make such interventions convenient too.
But in general, if the humans take care to label and route information
accurately on its first entry into the system, then the software
should be configured to make as much use of that metadata as
possible.</para>

<para>The advice in this chapter is intensely practical, based on
experiences with specific software and usage patterns.  But the point
is not just to teach a particular collection of techniques.  It is
also to demonstrate, by means of many small examples, the overall
attitude that will best encourage good information management in your
project.  This attitude will involve a combination of technical skills
and people skills.  The technical skills are essential because
information management software always requires configuration, plus a
certain amount of ongoing maintenance and tweaking as new needs arise
(for example, see the discussion of how to handle project growth in
<xref linkend="bug-filtering"/><phrase output="printed"> later in
this chapter</phrase>).  The people skills are necessary
because the human community also requires maintenance: it's not always
immediately obvious how to use these tools to full advantage, and in
some cases projects have conflicting conventions (for example, see the
discussion of setting <systemitem>Reply-to</systemitem> headers on
outgoing mailing list posts, in <xref linkend="mailing-lists"/>).
Everyone involved with the project will need to be encouraged, at the
right times and in the right ways, to do their part to keep the
project's information well organized.  The more involved the
contributor, the more complex and specialized the techniques she can
be expected to learn.</para>

<para>Information management has no cut-and-dried solution.  There are
too many variables.  You may finally get everything configured just
the way you want it, and have most of the community participating, but
then project growth will make some of those practices unscalable.  Or
project growth may stabilize, and the developer and user communities
settle into a comfortable relationship with the technical
infrastructure, but then someone will come along and invent a whole
new information management service, and pretty soon newcomers will be
asking why your project doesn't use it&mdash;for example, this is
happening now to a lot of free software projects that predate the
invention of the wiki (see
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki"/>).  Many questions are
matters of judgement, involving tradeoffs between the convenience of
those producing information and the convenience of those consuming it,
or between the time required to configure information management
software and the benefit it brings to the project.</para>

<para>Beware of the temptation to over-automate, that is, to automate
things that really require human attention.  Technical infrastructure
is important, but what makes a free software project work is
care&mdash;and intelligent expression of that care&mdash;by the humans
involved.  The technical infrastructure is mainly about giving humans
convenient ways to do that.</para>

<sect1 id="mailing-lists">
<title>Mailing Lists</title>

<para>Mailing lists are the bread and butter of project
communications.  If a user is exposed to any forum besides the web
pages, it is most likely to be one of the project's mailing lists.
But before they experience the mailing list itself, they will
experience the mailing list interface&mdash;that is, the mechanism
by which they join ("subscribe to") the list.  This brings us to Rule
#1 of mailing lists:</para>

<blockquote>
   <para><emphasis>Don't try to manage mailing lists by hand&mdash;get
   list management software.</emphasis></para>
</blockquote>

<para>It will be tempting to put this off.  Setting up mailing list
management software might seem like overkill at first.  Managing
small, low-traffic lists by hand will seem seductively easy: you just
set up a subscription address that forwards to you, and when someone
mails it, you add (or remove) their email address in some text file
that holds all the addresses on the list.  What could be
simpler?</para>

<para>The trick is that good mailing list management&mdash;which is
what people have come to expect&mdash;is not simple at all.  It's not
just about subscribing and unsubscribing users when they request.
It's also about moderating to prevent spam, offering the mailing list
in digest versus message-by-message form, providing standard list and
project information by means of auto-responders, and various other
things.  A human being monitoring a subscription address can supply
only a bare minimum of functionality, and even then not as reliably
and promptly as software could.</para>

<para>Modern list management software usually offers at least the
following features:</para>

<variablelist>

  <varlistentry><term>Both email- and web-based subscription</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>When a user subscribes to a list, she should
            <emphasis>promptly</emphasis> get an automated welcome
            message in reply, telling her what she has subscribed
            to, how to interact further with the mailing list
            software, and (most importantly) how to unsubscribe.  This
            automatic reply can be customized to contain
            project-specific information, of course, such as the
            project's web site, FAQ location, etc.</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>Subscription in either digest mode or
                      message-by-message mode</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>In digest mode, the subscriber receives one email per day,
            containing all the list activity for that day.  For people
            who are following a list loosely, without participating,
            digest mode is often preferable, because it allows them to
            scan all the subjects at once and avoid the distraction
            of emails coming in at random times.</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>Moderation features</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>To "moderate" is to check posts to make sure they are
            a)&nbsp;not&nbsp;spam, and b)&nbsp;on&nbsp;topic, before
            they go out to the entire list.  Moderation necessarily
            involves humans, but software can do a lot to make it
            easier.  There is more said about moderation
            later.</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>Administrative interface</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>Among other things, this enables an administrator to go in
            and remove obsolete addresses easily.  This can become
            urgent when a recipient's address starts sending automatic
            "I am no longer at this address" replies back to the list
            in response to every list post.  (Some mailing list
            software can even detect this by itself and unsubscribe
            the person automatically.)</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>Header manipulation</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>Many people have sophisticated filtering and replying
            rules set up in their mail readers.  Mailing list software
            can add and manipulate certain standard headers for these
            people to take advantage of (more details below).</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>Archiving</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>All posts to the managed lists are stored and made
            available on the web; alternatively, some mailing list
            software offers special interfaces for plugging in an
            external archiving tool such as MHonArc
            (<ulink url="http://www.mhonarc.org/"/>).  As
            <xref
            linkend="using-archives"/><phrase output="printed">

            discusses, archiving is crucial.</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

</variablelist>

<para>The point of all this is merely to emphasize that mailing list
management is a complex problem that has been given a lot of thought,
and mostly been solved.  You certainly don't need to become an expert
in it.  But you should be aware that there's always room to learn
more, and that list management will occupy your attention from time to
time in the course of running a free software project.  Below we'll
examine a few of the most common mailing list configuration
issues.</para>

<!-- ========================== subsection =========================== -->
<sect2 id="spam-prevention">
<title>Spam Prevention</title>

<para>Between when this sentence is written and when it is published,
the Internet-wide spam problem will probably double in
severity&mdash;or at least it will feel that way.  There was a time,
not so long ago, when one could run a mailing list without taking any
spam-prevention measures at all.  The occasional stray post would
still show up, but infrequently enough to be only a low-level
annoyance.  That era is gone forever.  Today, a mailing list that
takes no spam prevention measures will quickly be submerged in junk
emails, to the point of unusability.  Spam prevention is
mandatory.</para>

<para>We divide spam prevention into two categories: preventing spam
posts from appearing on your mailing lists, and preventing your
mailing list from being a source of new email addresses for spammers'
harvesters.  The former is more important, so we examine it
first.</para>

<sect3 id="spam-filtering">
<title>Filtering posts</title>

<para>There are three basic techniques for preventing spam posts, and
most mailing list software offers all three.  They are best used in
tandem:</para>

<orderedlist>

  <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Only auto-allow postings from
            list subscribers.</emphasis></para>

            <para>This is effective as far as it goes, and also
            involves very little administrative overhead, since it's
            usually just a matter of changing a setting in the mailing
            list software's configuration.  But note that posts which
            aren't automatically approved must not be simply
            discarded.  Instead, they should be passed along for
            moderation, for two reasons.  First, you want to allow
            non-subscribers to post.  A person with a question or
            suggestion should not need to subscribe to a mailing list
            just to make a single post there.  Second, even
            subscribers may sometimes post from an address other than
            the one by which they're subscribed.  Email addresses are
            not a reliable method of identifying people, and shouldn't
            be treated as such.</para>
            </listitem>

  <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Filter posts through
            spam-filtering software.</emphasis></para>

            <para>If the mailing list software makes it possible (most
            do), you can have posts filtered by spam-filtering
            software.  Automatic spam-filtering is not perfect, and
            never will be, since there is a never-ending arms race
            between spammers and filter writers.  However, it can
            greatly reduce the amount of spam that gets through to the
            moderation queue, and since the longer that queue is the
            more time humans must spend examining it, any amount of
            automated filtering is beneficial.</para>

            <para>There is not space here for detailed instructions
            on setting up spam filters.  You will have to consult
            your mailing list software's documentation for that (see
            <xref
            linkend="mailing-list-software"/><phrase
            output="printed"> later in this chapter</phrase>).  List
            software often comes with some built-in spam prevention
            features, but you may want to add some third-party
            filters.  I've had good experiences with these two:
            SpamAssassin
            (<ulink url="http://spamassassin.apache.org/"/>)
            and SpamProbe
            (<ulink url="http://spamprobe.sourceforge.net/"/>).  This
            is not a comment on the many other open source spam
            filters out there, some of which are apparently also quite
            good.  I just happen to have used those two myself and
            been satisfied with them.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Moderation.</emphasis></para>
            <para>For mails that aren't automatically allowed by
            virtue of being from a list subscriber, and which make it
            through the spam filtering software, if any, the last stage
            is <firstterm>moderation</firstterm>: the mail is routed
            to a special address, where a human examines it and
            confirms or rejects it.</para>

            <para>Confirming a post takes one of two forms: you can
            accept the post just this once, or you can tell the list
            software to allow this and all future posts from the same
            sender.  You almost always want to do the latter, in order
            to reduce the future moderation burden.  Details on how
            to confirm vary from system to system, but it's usually a
            matter of replying to a special address with the command
            "accept" (meaning accept just this one post) or "allow"
            (allow this and future posts).</para>

            <para>Rejecting is usually done by simply ignoring the
            moderation mail.  If the list software never receives
            confirmation that something is a valid post, then it won't
            pass that post on to the list, so simply dropping the
            moderation mail achieves the desired effect.  Sometimes
            you also have the option of responding with a "reject" or
            "deny" command, to automatically disapprove future mails
            from the same sender without even running them through
            moderation.  There is rarely any point doing this, since
            moderation is mostly about spam prevention, and spammers
            tend not to send from the same address twice anyway.</para>
            </listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Be sure to use moderation <emphasis>only</emphasis> for
filtering out spams and clearly off-topic messages, such as when
someone accidentally posts to the wrong mailing list.  The moderation
system will usually give you a way to respond directly to the sender,
but don't use that method to answer questions that really belong on
the mailing list itself, even if you know the answer off the top of
your head.  To do so would deprive the project's community of an
accurate picture of what sorts of questions people are asking, and
deprive them of a chance to answer questions themselves and/or see
answers from others.  Mailing list moderation is strictly about
keeping the list free of junk and off-topic emails, nothing
more.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="address-hiding">
<title>Address hiding in archives</title>

<para>To prevent your mailing lists from being a source of addresses
for spammers, a common technique is for the archives to obscure
people's email addresses, for example by replacing</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><literal>jrandom@somedomain.com</literal></para>
    </blockquote>

<para>with</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><literal>jrandom_AT_somedomain.com</literal></para>
    </blockquote>

<para>or</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><literal>jrandomNOSPAM@somedomain.com</literal></para>
    </blockquote>

<para>or some similarly obvious (to a human) encoding.  Since spam
address harvesters often work by crawling through web
pages&mdash;including your mailing list's online archives&mdash;and
looking for sequences containing "@", encoding the addresses is a way
of making people's email addresses invisible or useless to spammers.
This does nothing to prevent spam from being sent to the mailing list
itself, of course, but it does avoid increasing the amount of spam
sent directly to list users' personal addresses.</para>

<para>Address hiding can be controversial.  Some people like it a lot,
and will be surprised if your archives don't do it automatically.
Other people think it's too much of an inconvenience (because humans
also have to translate the addresses back before using them).
Sometimes people assert that it's ineffective, because a harvester
could in theory compensate for any consistent encoding pattern.
However, note that there is empirical evidence that address hiding
<emphasis>is</emphasis> effective, see <ulink
url="http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml"/>.</para>

<para>Ideally, the list management software would leave the choice up
to each individual subscriber, either through a special yes/no header
or a setting in that subscriber's list account preferences.  However,
I don't know of any software which offers per-subscriber or per-post
choice in the matter, so for now the list manager must make a decision
for everyone (assuming the archiver offers the feature at all, which
is not always the case).  I lean very mildly toward turning
address hiding on.  Some people are very careful to avoid posting
their email addresses on web pages or anywhere else a spam harvester
might see it, and they would be disappointed to have all that care
thrown away by a mailing list archive; meanwhile, the inconvenience
address hiding imposes on archive users is very slight, since it's
trivial to transform an obscured address back to a valid one if you
need to reach the person.  But keep in mind that, in the end, it's
still an arms race: by the time you read this, harvesters might well
have evolved to the point where they can recognize most common forms
of hiding, and we'll have to think of something else.</para>

</sect3>

</sect2>

<!-- ========================== subsection =========================== -->
<sect2 id="header-management">
<title>Identification and Header Management</title>

<para>List subscribers often want to put mails from the list into a
project-specific folder, separate from their other mail.  Their
mail reading software can do this automatically by examining the mail's
<firstterm>headers</firstterm>.  The headers are the fields at the top
of the mail that indicate the sender, recipient, subject, date, and
various other things about the message.  Certain headers are
well known and effectively mandatory:</para>

<screen>
From: ...
To: ...
Subject: ...
Date: ...
</screen>

<para>Others are optional, though still quite standard.  For example,
emails are not strictly required to have the</para>

<screen>
Reply-to: sender@email.address.here
</screen>

<para>header, but most do, because it gives recipients a foolproof way
to reach the author (it is especially useful when the author had to
send from an address other than the one to which replies should be
directed).</para>

<para>Some mail reading software offers an easy-to-use interface for
filing mails based on patterns in the Subject header.  This leads
people to request that the mailing list add an automatic prefix to all
Subjects, so they can set their readers to look for that prefix and
automatically file the mails in the right folder.  The idea is that
the original author would write:</para>

<screen>
Subject: Making the 2.5 release.
</screen>

<para>but the mail would show up on the list looking like this:</para>

<screen>
Subject: [discuss@lists.example.org] Making the 2.5 release.
</screen>

<para>Although most list management software offers the option to do
this, I strongly recommend against turning the option on.  The problem
it solves can easily be solved in much less obtrusive ways, and the
cost of eating space in the Subject field is far too high.
Experienced mailing list users typically scan the Subjects of the
day's incoming list mail to decide what to read and/or respond to.
Prepending the list's name to the Subject can push the right side of
the Subject off the screen, rendering it invisible.  This obscures
information that people depend on to decide what mails to open, thus
reducing the overall functionality of the mailing list for
everyone.</para>

<para>Instead of munging the Subject header, teach your users to take
advantage of the other standard headers, starting with the To header,
which should say the mailing list's name:</para>

<screen>
To: &lt;discuss@lists.example.org&gt;
</screen>

<para>Any mail reader that can filter on Subject should be able to filter on
To just as easily.</para>

<para>There are a few other optional-but-standard headers expected for
mailing lists.  Filtering on these is even more reliable than using
the "To" or "Cc" headers; since these headers are added to each post
by the mailing list management software itself, some users may be
counting on their presence:</para>

<screen>
list-help: &lt;mailto:discuss-help@lists.example.org&gt;
list-unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:discuss-unsubscribe@lists.example.org&gt;
list-post: &lt;mailto:discuss@lists.example.org&gt;
Delivered-To: mailing list discuss@lists.example.org
Mailing-List: contact discuss-help@lists.example.org; run by ezmlm
</screen>

<para>For the most part, they are self-explanatory.  See <ulink
url="http://www.nisto.com/listspec/list-manager-intro.html"/> for more
explanation, or if you need the really detailed, formal specification,
see <ulink url="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2369.html"/>.
</para>

<para>Notice how these headers imply that if you have a mailing list
named "list", then you also have administrative addresses "list-help"
and "list-unsubscribe" available.  In addition to these, it is normal
to have "list-subscribe", for joining, and "list-owner", for reaching
the list administrators.  Depending on the list management software
you use, these and/or various other administrative addresses may be
set up; the documentation will have details.  Usually a complete
explanation of all these special addresses is mailed to each new user
as part of an automated "welcome mail" on subscribing.  You yourself
will probably get a copy of this welcome mail.  If you don't, then ask
someone else for a copy, so you know what your users are seeing when
they join the list.  Keep the copy handy so you can answer questions
about the mailing list functions, or better yet, put it on a web page
somewhere.  That way when people lose their own copy of the
instructions and post to ask "How do I unsubscribe from this list?",
you can just hand them the URL.</para>

<para>Some mailing list software offers an option to append
unsubscription instructions to the bottom of every post.  If that
option is available, turn it on.  It causes only a couple of extra
lines per message, in a harmless location, and it can save you a lot
of time, by cutting down on the number of people who mail you&mdash;or
worse, mail the list!&mdash;asking how to unsubscribe.</para>

<title>The Great Reply-to Debate</title>

<para>Earlier, in <xref linkend="avoid-private-discussions"/>, I stressed the
importance of making sure discussions stay in public forums, and
talked about how active measures are sometimes needed to prevent
conversations from trailing off into private email threads;
furthermore, this chapter is all about setting up project
communications software to do as much of the work for you as possible.
Therefore, if the mailing list management software offers a way to
automatically cause discussions to stay on the list, you would think
turning that feature on would be the obvious choice.</para>

<para>Well, not quite.  There is such a feature, but it has some
pretty severe disadvantages.  The question of whether or not to use it
is one of the hottest debates in mailing list
management&mdash;admittedly, not a controversy that's likely to make
the evening news in your city, but it can flare up from time to time
in free software projects.  Below, I will describe the feature, give
the major arguments on both sides, and make the best recommendation I
can.</para>

<para>The feature itself is very simple: the mailing list software
can, if you wish, automatically set the Reply-to header on every post
to redirect replies to the mailing list.  That is, no matter what the
original sender puts in the Reply-to header (or even if they don't
include one at all), by the time the list subscribers see the post,
the header will contain the list address:</para>

<screen>
Reply-to: discuss@lists.example.org
</screen>

<para>On its face, this seems like a good thing.  Because virtually
all mail reading software pays attention to the Reply-to header, now
when anyone responds to a post, their response will be automatically
addressed to the entire list, not just to the sender of the message
being responded to.  Of course, the responder can still manually
change where the message goes, but the important thing is that
<emphasis>by default</emphasis> replies are directed to the list.
It's a perfect example of using technology to encourage
collaboration.</para>

<para>Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages.  The first is known
as the <firstterm>Can't Find My Way Back Home</firstterm> problem:
sometimes the original sender will put their "real" email address in
the Reply-to field, because for one reason or another they send email
from a different address than where they receive it.  People who
always read and send from the same location don't have this problem,
and may be surprised that it even exists.  But for those who have
unusual email configurations, or who cannot control how the From
address on their mails looks (perhaps because they send from work and
do not have any influence over the IT department), using Reply-to may
be the only way they have to ensure that responses reach them.  When
such a person posts to a mailing list that he's not subscribed to, his
setting of Reply-to becomes essential information.  If the list
software overwrites it, he may never see the responses to his post.</para>

<para>The second disadvantage has to do with expectations, and in my
opinion is the most powerful argument against Reply-to munging.  Most
experienced mail users are accustomed to two basic methods of
replying: <firstterm>reply-to-all</firstterm> and
<firstterm>reply-to-author</firstterm>.  All modern mail reading
software has separate keys for these two actions.  Users know that to
reply to everyone (that is, including the list), they should choose
reply-to-all, and to reply privately to the author, they should choose
reply-to-author.  Although you want to encourage people to reply to
the list whenever possible, there are certainly circumstances where a
private reply is the responder's prerogative&mdash;for example, they
may want to say something confidential to the author of the original
message, something that would be inappropriate on the public
list.</para>

<para>Now consider what happens when the list has overridden the
original sender's Reply-to.  The responder hits the reply-to-author
key, expecting to send a private message back to the original author.
Because that's the expected behavior, he may not bother to look
carefully at the recipient address in the new message.  He composes
his private, confidential message, one which perhaps says embarrassing
things about someone on the list, and hits the send key.
Unexpectedly, a few minutes later his message appears <emphasis>on the
mailing list!</emphasis> True, in theory he should have looked
carefully at the recipient field, and should not have assumed anything
about the Reply-to header.  But authors almost always set Reply-to to
their own personal address (or rather, their mail software sets it for
them), and many longtime email users have come to expect that.  In
fact, when a person deliberately sets Reply-to to some other address,
such as the list, he usually makes a point of mentioning this in the
body of the message, so people won't be surprised at what happens when
they reply.</para>

<para>Because of the possibly severe consequences of this unexpected
behavior, my own preference is to configure list management software
to never touch the Reply-to header.  This is one instance where using
technology to encourage collaboration has, it seems to me, potentially
dangerous side-effects.  However, there are also some powerful
arguments on the other side of this debate.  Whichever way you choose,
you will occasionally get people posting to your list asking why you
didn't choose the other way.  Since this is not something you ever
want as the main topic of discussion on your list, it might be good to
have a canned response ready, of the sort that's more likely to stop
discussion than encourage it.  Make sure you do
<emphasis>not</emphasis> insist that your decision, whichever it is,
is obviously the only right and sensible one (even if you think that's
the case).  Instead, point out that this is a very old debate, there
are good arguments on both sides, no choice is going to satisfy
all users, and therefore you just made the best decision you
could.  Politely ask that the subject not be revisited unless someone
has something genuinely new to say, then stay out of the thread and
hope it dies a natural death.</para>

<para>Someone may suggest a vote to choose one way or the other.  You
can do that if you want, but I personally do not feel that counting
heads is a satisfactory solution in this case.  The penalty for
someone who is surprised by the behavior is so huge (accidentally
sending a private mail to a public list), and the inconvenience for
everyone else is fairly slight (occasionally having to remind someone
to respond to the whole list instead of just to you), that it's not
clear that the majority, even though they are the majority, should be
able to put the minority at such risk.</para>

<para>I have not addressed all aspects of this issue here, just the
ones that seemed of overriding importance.  For a full discussion, see
these two canonical documents, which are the ones people always cite
when they're having this debate:

<para>Despite the mild preference indicated above, I do not feel there
is a "right" answer to this question, and happily participate in many

thing you can do is settle on one way or the other early, and try not
to get entangled in debates about it after that.</para>

<sect3 id="reply-fantasies">
<title>Two fantasies</title>

<para>Someday, someone will get the bright idea to implement a
<firstterm>reply-to-list</firstterm> key in a mail reader.  It would
use some of the custom list headers mentioned earlier to figure out
the address of the mailing list, and then address the reply directly
to the list only, leaving off any other recipient addresses, since
most are probably subscribed to the list anyway.  Eventually, other
mail readers will pick up the feature, and this whole debate will go
away.  (Actually, the <ulink url="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</ulink>
mail reader does offer this feature.<footnote><para>Shortly after this
book appeared, <ulink url="http://www.michaelbernstein.com/"
>Michael Bernstein</ulink> wrote me to say: "There are other email
clients that implement a reply-to-list function besides Mutt. For
example, Evolution has this function as a keyboard shortcut, but not a
button (Ctrl+L)."</para></footnote>)</para>

<para>An even better solution would be for Reply-to munging to be a
per-subscriber preference.  Those who want the list to set Reply-to
munged (either on others' posts or on their own posts) could ask for
that, and those who don't would ask for Reply-to to be left alone.
However, I don't know of any list management software that offers this
on a per-subscriber basis.  For now, we seem to be stuck with a global
setting.<footnote><para>Since I wrote that, I've learned that there is
at least one list management system that offers this
feature: <ulink url="http://siesta.unixbeard.net/">Siesta</ulink>.

<sect2 id="archiving">
<title>Archiving</title>

<para>The technical details of setting up mailing list archiving are
specific to the software that's running the list, and are beyond the
scope of this book.  When choosing or configuring an archiver,
consider these qualities:</para>

<variablelist>

  <varlistentry><term>Prompt updating</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>People will often want to refer to an archived post made
            within the last hour or two.  If possible, the archiver
            should archive each post instantaneously, so that by the
            time a post appears on the mailing list, it's already
            present in the archives.  If that option isn't available,
            then at least try to set the archiver to update itself
            every hour or so.  (By default, some archivers run their
            update processes once per night, but in practice that's
            far too much lag time for an active mailing list.)</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>Referential stability</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>Once a message is archived at a particular URL, it should
            remain accessible at that exact same URL forever, or as
            close to forever as possible.  Even if the archives are
            rebuilt, restored from backup, or otherwise fixed, any
            URLs that have already been made publicly available
            should remain the same.  Stable references make it
            possible for Internet search engines to index the
            archives, which is a major boon to users looking for
            answers.  Stable references are also important because
            mailing list posts and threads are often linked to from
            the bug tracker (see
            <xref
            linkend="bug-tracker"/><phrase output="printed">
            later in this chapter</phrase>) or
            from other project documents.</para>

      <para>Ideally, mailing list software would include a message's
            archive URL, or at least the message-specific portion of
            the URL, in a header when it distributes the message to
            recipients.  That way people who have a copy of the
            message would be able to know its archive location
            without having to actually visit the archives, which would
            be helpful because any operation that involves one's web
            browser is automatically time-consuming.  Whether any
            mailing list software actually offers this feature, I don't
            know; unfortunately, the ones I have used do not.
            However, it's something to look for (or, if you write
            mailing list software, it's a feature to consider
            implementing, please).</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>Backups</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>It should be reasonably obvious how to back up the
            archives, and the restoration recipe should not be too
            difficult.  In other words, don't treat your archiver as a
            black box.  You (or someone in your project) should know
            where it's storing the messages, and how to regenerate the
            actual archive pages from the message store if it should
            ever become necessary.  Those archives are precious
            data&mdash;a project that loses them loses a good part of
            its collective memory.</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>Thread support</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>It should be possible to go from any individual message to
            the <firstterm>thread</firstterm> (group of related
            messages) that that original message is part of.  Each
            thread should have its own URL too, separate from the URLs
            of the individual messages in the thread.</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>Searchability</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>An archiver that doesn't support searching&mdash;on the
            bodies of messages, as well as on authors and
            subjects&mdash;is close to useless.  Note that some archivers 
            support searching by simply farming the work out to an
            external search engine such as <ulink
            url="http://www.google.com/">Google</ulink>.  This is
            acceptable, but direct search support is usually more
            fine-tuned, because it allows the searcher to specify that
            the match must appear in a subject line versus the body,
            for example.</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

</variablelist>

<para>The above is just a technical checklist to help you evaluate and
set up an archiver.  Getting people to
actually <emphasis>use</emphasis> the archiver to the project's
advantage is discussed in later chapters, in particular

<title>Version Control</title>

<para>A <firstterm>version control system</firstterm> (or
<firstterm>revision control system</firstterm>) is a combination of
technologies and practices for tracking and controlling changes to a
project's files, in particular to source code, documentation, and web
pages.  If you have never used version control before, the first thing
you should do is go find someone who has, and get them to join your
project.  These days, everyone will expect at least your project's
source code to be under version control, and probably will not take
the project seriously if it doesn't use version control with at least
minimal competence.</para>

<para>The reason version control is so universal is that it helps with
virtually every aspect of running a project: inter-developer
communications, release management, bug management, code stability and
experimental development efforts, and attribution and authorization of
changes by particular developers.  The version control system provides
a central coordinating force among all of these areas.  The core of
version control is <firstterm>change management</firstterm>:
identifying each discrete change made to the project's files,
annotating each change with metadata like the change's date and
author, and then replaying these facts to whoever asks, in whatever
way they ask.  It is a communications mechanism where a change is the
basic unit of information.</para>

<para>This section does not discuss all aspects of using a version
control system.  It's so all-encompassing that it must be addressed
topically throughout the book.  Here, we will concentrate on choosing
and setting up a version control system in a way that will foster
cooperative development down the road.</para>

<!-- ========================== subsection =========================== -->
<sect2 id="vc-vocabulary">
<title>Version Control Vocabulary</title>

<para>This book cannot teach you how to use version control if you've
never used it before, but it would be impossible to discuss the
subject without a few key terms.  These terms are useful independently
of any particular version control system: they are the basic nouns and
verbs of networked collaboration, and will be used generically
throughout the rest of this book.  Even if there were no version
control systems in the world, the problem of change management would
remain, and these words give us a language for talking about that
problem concisely.

<variablelist>

 <varlistentry id="vc-vocabulary-commit">
  <term><firstterm>commit</firstterm></term>
  <listitem><para>To make a change to the project; more formally, to
  store a change in the version control database in such a way that it
  can be incorporated into future releases of the project.  "Commit"
  can be used as a verb or a noun.  As a noun, it is essentially
  synonymous with "change".  For example: "I just committed a fix for
  the server crash bug people have been reporting on Mac OS X.  Jay,
  could you please review the commit and check that I'm not misusing
  the allocator there?"</para></listitem>

  among the most important documents in any project: they are the
  bridge between the highly technical language of individual code

  and project progress.  Later in this section, we'll look at ways to
  distribute log messages to the appropriate audiences; also, <xref

  <listitem><para>To ask that others' changes (commits) be

  your copy "up-to-date".  This is a very common operation; most
  developers update their code several times a day, so that they know
  they're running roughly the same thing the other developers are
  running, and so that if they see a bug, they can be pretty sure it
  hasn't been fixed already.  For example: "Hey, I noticed the

  all changes to the project.  Others are decentralized: each
  developer has his own repository, and changes can be swapped back
  and forth between repositories arbitrarily.  The version control
  system keeps track of dependencies between changes, and when it's
  time to make a release, a particular set of changes is approved for
  that release.  The question of whether centralized or decentralized
  is better is one of the enduring holy wars of software development;

  "revision", "change", or "changeset" to refer to a set of changes
  committed together as one conceptual unit.</para> 

  <para>These terms occasionally have distinct technical meanings in
  different version control systems, but the general idea is always
  the same: they give a way to speak precisely about exact points in
  time in the history of a file or a set of files (say, immediately
  before and after a bug is fixed).  For example: "Oh yes, she fixed
  that in revision 10" or "She fixed that in revision 10 of

  <para>The word <firstterm>version</firstterm> is sometimes used as a

  of a version of a piece of software&mdash;that is, the release or
  edition number, as in "Version 1.0".  However, since the phrase
  "version control" is already standard, I will continue to use it as

  <para>Branches offer a way to isolate different lines of development
  from each other.  For example, a branch can be used for experimental
  development that would be too destabilizing for the main trunk.  Or
  conversely, a branch can be used as a place to stabilize a new
  release.  During the release process, regular development would
  continue uninterrupted in the main branch of the repository;
  meanwhile, on the release branch, no changes are allowed except
  those approved by the release managers.  This way, making a release

<title>Choosing a Version Control System</title>

<para>As of this writing, the two most popular version control systems
in the free software world are <firstterm>Concurrent Versions
System</firstterm> (<firstterm>CVS</firstterm>,
<ulink url="http://www.cvshome.org/"/>)
and <firstterm>Subversion</firstterm> (<firstterm>SVN</firstterm>,
<ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org/"/>).</para>

<para>CVS has been around for a long time.  Most experienced
developers are already familiar with it, it does more or less what you
need, and since it's been popular for a long time, you probably won't
end up in any long debates about whether or not it was the right
choice.  CVS has some disadvantages, however.  It doesn't provide an
easy way to refer to multi-file changes; it doesn't allow you to
rename or copy files under version control (so if you need to
reorganize your code tree after starting the project, it can be a real
pain); it has poor merging support; it doesn't handle large files or
binary files very well; and some operations are slow when large
numbers of files are involved.</para>

<para>None of CVS's flaws is fatal, and it is still quite popular.
However, in the last few years the more recent Subversion has been
gaining ground, especially in newer
projects.<footnote><para>See <ulink url="http://cia.vc/stats/vcs"/> and
<ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org/svn-dav-securityspace-survey.html"/>
for evidence of this growth.</para></footnote>.  If you're starting a
new project, I recommend Subversion.</para>

<para>On the other hand, since I'm involved in the Subversion project,
my objectivity might reasonably be questioned.  And in the last few
years a number of new open-source version control systems have
appeared.  <xref linkend="vc-systems"/> lists all the ones I know of,
in rough order of popularity.  As the list makes clear, deciding on a
version control system could easily become a lifelong research
project.  Possibly you will be spared the decision because it will be
made for you by your hosting site.  But if you must choose, consult
with your other developers, ask around to see what people have
experience with, then pick one and run with it.  Any stable,
production-ready version control system will do; you don't have to
worry too much about making a drastically wrong decision.  If you
simply can't make up your mind, then go with Subversion.  It's fairly
easy to learn, and is likely to remain a standard for at least a few
years.</para>

</sect2>


<!-- ========================== subsection =========================== -->
<sect2 id="vc-using">
<title>Using the Version Control System</title>

<para>The recommendations in this section are not targeted toward a
particular version control system, and should be simple to implement
in any of them.  Consult your specific system's documentation for
details.</para>

<sect3 id="version-everything">
<title>Version everything</title>

<para>Keep not only your project's source code under version control,
but also its web pages, documentation, FAQ, design notes, and anything
else that people might want to edit.  Keep them right next to the
source code, in the same repository tree.  Any piece of information
worth writing down is worth versioning&mdash;that is, any piece of
information that could change.  Things that don't change should be
archived, not versioned.  For example, an email, once posted, does not
change; therefore, versioning it wouldn't make sense (unless it becomes
part of some larger, evolving document).</para>

<para>The reason versioning everything together in one place is
important is so people only have to learn one mechanism for submitting
changes.  Often a contributor will start out making edits to the web
pages or documentation, and move to small code contributions later,
for example.  When the project uses the same system for all kinds of
submissions, people only have to learn the ropes once.  Versioning
everything together also means that new features can be committed
together with their documentation updates, that branching the code
will branch the documentation too, etc.</para>

<para>Don't keep <firstterm>generated files</firstterm> under version
control.  They are not truly editable data, since they are produced
programmatically from other files.  For example, some build systems
create <filename>configure</filename> based on the template
<filename>configure.in</filename>.  To make a change to the
<filename>configure</filename>, one would edit
<filename>configure.in</filename> and then regenerate; thus, only the
template <filename>configure.in</filename> is an "editable file."
Just version the templates&mdash;if you version the result files as
well, people will inevitably forget to regenerate when they commit a
change to a template, and the resulting inconsistencies will cause no
end of confusion.<footnote><para>For a different opinion on the
question of versioning <filename>configure</filename> files, see
Alexey Makhotkin's post "<citetitle>configure.in and version
control</citetitle>" at
<ulink url="http://versioncontrolblog.com/2007/01/08/configurein-and-version-control/"/>.</para></footnote></para>

<para>The rule that all editable data should be kept under version
control has one unfortunate exception: the bug tracker.  Bug databases
hold plenty of editable data, but for technical reasons generally
cannot store that data in the main version control system.  (Some
trackers have primitive versioning features of their own, however,
independent of the project's main repository.)</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="vc-browsing">
<title>Browsability</title>

<para>The project's repository should be browsable on the Web.  This
means not only the ability to see the latest revisions of the
project's files, but to go back in time and look at earlier revisions,
view the differences between revisions, read log messages for selected
changes, etc.</para>

<para>Browsability is important because it is a lightweight portal to
project data.  If the repository cannot be viewed through a web
browser, then someone wanting to inspect a particular file (say, to
see if a certain bugfix had made it into the code) would first have to
install version control client software locally, which could turn
their simple query from a two-minute task into a half-hour or longer
task.</para>

<para>Browsability also implies canonical URLs for viewing specific
revisions of files, and for viewing the latest revision at any given
time.  This can be very useful in technical discussions or when
pointing people to documentation.  For example, instead of saying "For
bug management guidelines, see the community-guide/index.html file
in your working copy," one can say "For bug management guidelines,
see
<emphasis>http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/</emphasis>,"
giving a URL that always points to the latest revision of the
<filename>community-guides/index.html</filename> file.  The URL is
better because it is completely unambiguous, and avoids the question
of whether the addressee has an up-to-date working copy.</para>

<para>Some version control systems come with built-in
repository-browsing mechanisms, while others rely on third-party tools
to do it.  Three such tools are <firstterm>ViewVC</firstterm> (<ulink
url="http://viewvc.org/"/>),
<firstterm>CVSWeb</firstterm> (<ulink
url="http://www.freebsd.org/projects/cvsweb.html"/>), and
<firstterm>WebSVN</firstterm> (<ulink
url="http://websvn.tigris.org/"/>).  The first works with both CVS and
Subversion, the second with CVS only, and the third with Subversion
only.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="commit-emails">
<title>Commit emails</title>

<para>Every commit to the repository should generate an email showing
who made the change, when they made it, what files and directories
changed, and how they changed.  The email should go to a special
mailing list devoted to commit emails, separate from the mailing lists
to which humans post.  Developers and other interested parties should
be encouraged to subscribe to the commits list, as it is the most
effective way to keep up with what's happening in the project at the
code level.  Aside from the obvious technical benefits of peer review
(see <xref linkend="code-review"/>), commit emails help create a
sense of community, because they establish a shared environment in
which people can react to events (commits) that they know are visible
to others as well.</para>

<para>The specifics of setting up commit emails will vary depending on
your version control system, but usually there's a script or other
packaged facility for doing it.  If you're having trouble finding it,
try looking for documentation on <firstterm>hooks</firstterm>,
specifically a <firstterm>post-commit hook</firstterm>, also called
the <firstterm>loginfo hook</firstterm> in CVS.  Post-commit hooks are
a general means of launching automated tasks in response to commits.
The hook is triggered by an individual commit, is fed all the
information about that commit, and is then free to use that
information to do anything&mdash;for example, to send out an
email.</para>

<para>With pre-packaged commit email systems, you may want to
modify some of the default behaviors:</para>

<orderedlist>

  <listitem>
  <para>Some commit mailers don't include the actual diffs in the
  email, but instead provide a URL to view the change on the web using
  the repository browsing system.  While it's good to provide the URL,
  so the change can be referred to later, it is also
  <emphasis>very</emphasis> important that the commit email include
  the diffs themselves.  Reading email is already part of people's
  routine, so if the content of the change is visible right there in
  the commit email, developers will review the commit on the spot,
  without leaving their mail reader.  If they have to click on a URL to
  review the change, most won't do it, because that requires a new
  action instead of a continuation of what they were already doing.
  Furthermore, if the reviewer wants to ask something about the
  change, it's vastly easier to hit reply-with-text and simply
  annotate the quoted diff than it is to visit a web page and
  laboriously cut-and-paste parts of the diff from web browser to
  email client.</para>

  <para>(Of course, if the diff is huge, such as when a large body of
  new code has been added to the repository, then it makes sense to
  omit the diff and offer only the URL.  Most commit mailers can do
  this kind of limiting automatically.  If yours can't, then it's
  still better to include diffs, and live with the occasional huge
  email, than to leave the diffs off entirely.  Convenient reviewing
  and commenting is a cornerstone of cooperative development, much
  too important to do without.)</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para>The commit emails should set their Reply-to header
  to the regular development list, not the commit email list.  That
  is, when someone reviews a commit and writes a response, their
  response should be automatically directed toward the human
  development list, where technical issues are normally discussed.
  There are a few reasons for this.  First, you want to keep all
  technical discussion on one list, because that's where people expect
  it to happen, and because that way there's only one archive to
  search.  Second, there might be interested parties not subscribed to
  the commit email list.  Third, the commit email list advertises
  itself as a service for watching commits, not for watching commits
  <emphasis>and</emphasis> occasional technical discussions.  Those who
  subscribed to the commit email list did not sign up for anything but
  commit emails; sending them other material via that list would
  violate an implicit contract.  Fourth, people often write programs
  that read the commit email list and process the results (for
  display on a web page, for example).  Those programs are prepared to
  handle consistently-formatted commit emails, but not inconsistent
  human-written mails.</para>

  <para>Note that this advice to set Reply-to does not contradict the
  recommendations in
  <xref linkend="reply-to"/><phrase output="printed"> earlier in
  this chapter</phrase>.  It's
  always okay for the <emphasis>sender</emphasis> of a message to set
  Reply-to.  In this case, the sender is the version control system
  itself, and it sets Reply-to in order to indicate that the
  appropriate place for replies is the development mailing list, not
  the commit list.</para>

  </listitem>

</orderedlist>

<sidebar id="cia">
<title>CIA: A Standardized Change Publication Mechanism</title>

<para>Commit emails are not the only way to propagate change news.
You can also install CIA (<ulink url="http://cia.vc/"/>), a real-time
commit statistics aggregator and distributor.  The most popular use of
CIA is to send commit notifications to IRC channels, so that people
logged into those channels see the commits happening in real time.
Though of somewhat less technical utility than commit emails, since
observers might or might not be around when a commit notice pops up in
IRC, this technique is of immense <emphasis>social</emphasis> utility.
People get the sense of being part of something alive and active, and
feel that they can see progress being made right before their
eyes.  And because the notifications appear in a shared space, people
in the chat room often react in real time, reviewing the commit and
commenting on it on the spot.</para>

<para>The way CIA works is that you invoke its notifier program
from your post-commit hook.  The notifier formats the commit
information into an XML message, which it sends to a central server
(typically <literal>cia.vi</literal>).  That server then
distributes the commit information to other forums.</para>

<para>CIA can also be configured to send out <ulink
url="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html">RSS</ulink>
feeds.  See the documentation at <ulink url="http://cia.vc/"/>
for details.</para>

<para>To see an example of CIA in action, point your IRC
client at <literal>irc.freenode.net</literal>, channel
<literal>#commits</literal>, which shows activity across all the
projects CIA is watching.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="branches">
<title>Use branches to avoid bottlenecks</title>

<para>Non-expert version control users are sometimes a bit afraid of
branching and merging.  This is probably a side effect of CVS's
popularity: CVS's interface for branching and merging is somewhat
counterintuitive, so many people have learned to avoid those
operations entirely.</para>

<para>If you are among those people, resolve right now to conquer any
fears you may have and take the time to learn how to do branching and
merging.  They are not difficult operations, once you get used to
them, and they become increasingly important as a project acquires
more developers.</para>

<para>Branches are valuable because they turn a scarce
resource&mdash;working room in the project's code&mdash;into an
abundant one.  Normally, all developers work together in the same
sandbox, constructing the same castle.  When someone wants to add a
new drawbridge, but can't convince everyone else that it would be an
improvement, branching makes it possible for her to go to an isolated
corner and try it out.  If the effort succeeds, she can invite the
other developers to examine the result.  If everyone agrees that the
result is good, they can tell the version control system to move
("merge") the drawbridge from the branch castle over to the main
castle.</para>

<para>It's easy to see how this ability helps collaborative
development.  People need the freedom to try new things without
feeling like they're interfering with others' work.  Equally
importantly, there are times when code needs to be isolated from the
usual development churn, in order to get a bug fixed or a release
stabilized (see <xref linkend="stabilizing-a-release"/> and
<xref linkend="release-lines"/><phrase output="printed"> in
<xref linkend="development-cycle"/></phrase>) without worrying
about tracking a moving target.</para>

<para>Use branches liberally, and encourage others to use them.  But
also make sure that a given branch is only active for exactly as long
as needed.  Every active branch is a slight drain on the community's
attention.  Even those who are not working in a branch still maintain
a peripheral awareness of what's going on in it.  Such awareness is
desirable, of course, and commit emails should be sent out for branch
commits just as for any other commit.  But branches should not become
a mechanism for dividing the development community.  With rare
exceptions, the eventual goal of most branches should be to merge
their changes back into the main line and disappear.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="vc-singularity">
<title>Singularity of information</title>

<para>Merging has an important corollary: never commit the same change
twice.  That is, a given change should enter the version control
system exactly once.  The revision (or set of revisions) in which the
change entered is its unique identifier from then on.  If it needs to
be applied to branches other than the one on which it entered, then it
should be merged from its original entry point to those other
destinations&mdash;as opposed to committing a textually identical
change, which would have the same effect in the code, but would make
accurate bookkeeping and release management impossible.</para>

<para>The practical effects of this advice differ from one version
control system to another.  In some systems, merges are special
events, fundamentally distinct from commits, and carry their own
metadata with them.  In others, the results of merges are committed
the same way other changes are committed, so the primary means of
distinguishing a "merge commit" from a "new change commit" is in the
log message.  In a merge's log message, don't repeat the log message
of the original change.  Instead, just indicate that this is a merge,
and give the identifying revision of the original change, with at most
a one-sentence summary of its effect.  If someone wants to see the
full log message, she should consult the original revision.</para>

<para>The reason it's important to avoid repeating the log message is
that log messages are sometimes edited after they've been committed.
If a change's log message were repeated at each merge destination,
then even if someone edited the original message, she'd still leave
all the repeats uncorrected&mdash;which would only cause confusion
down the road.</para>

<para>The same principle applies to reverting a change.  If a change
is withdrawn from the code, then the log message for the reversion
should merely state that some specific revision(s) is being reverted,
<emphasis>not</emphasis> describe the actual code change that results
from the reversion, since the semantics of the change can be derived
by reading the original log message and change.  Of course, the
reversion's log message should also state the reason why the change is
being reverted, but it should not duplicate anything from the original
change's log message.  If possible, go back and edit the original
change's log message to point out that it was reverted.</para>

<para>All of the above implies that you should use a consistent syntax
for referring to revisions.  This is helpful not only in log messages,
but in emails, the bug tracker, and elsewhere.  If you're using
CVS, I suggest "<literal>path/to/file/in/project/tree:REV</literal>",
where REV is a CVS revision number such as "1.76".  If you're using
Subversion, the standard syntax for revision 1729 is "r1729" (file
paths are not needed because Subversion uses global revision numbers).
In other systems, there is usually a standard syntax for expressing
the changeset name.  Whatever the appropriate syntax is for your
system, encourage people to use it when referring to changes.
Consistent expression of change names makes project bookkeeping much
easier (as we will see in <xref linkend="communications"/> and
<xref linkend="development-cycle"/>), and since a lot of the
bookkeeping will be done by volunteers, it needs to be as easy as
possible.</para>

<para>See also
<xref
linkend="releases-and-daily-development"/><phrase
output="printed"> in
<xref linkend="development-cycle"/></phrase>.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="vc-authz">
<title>Authorization</title>

<para>Most version control systems offer a feature whereby certain
people can be allowed or disallowed from committing in specific
sub-areas of the repository.  Following the principle that when handed
a hammer, people start looking around for nails, many projects use
this feature with abandon, carefully granting people access to just
those areas where they have been approved to commit, and making sure
they can't commit anywhere else.  (See
<xref linkend="committers"/><phrase output="printed"> in
<xref linkend="managing-volunteers"/></phrase> for how projects
decide who can commit where.)</para>

<para>There is probably little harm done by exercising such tight
control, but a more relaxed policy is fine too.  Some projects simply
use an honor system: when a person is granted commit access, even for
a sub-area of the repository, what they actually receive is a password
that allows them to commit anywhere in the project.  They're just
asked to keep their commits in their area.  Remember that there is no
real risk here: in an active project, all commits are reviewed anyway.
If someone commits where they're not supposed to, others will
notice it and say something.  If a change needs to be undone, that's
simple enough&mdash;everything's under version control anyway, so
just revert.</para>

<para>There are several advantages to the relaxed approach.  First, as
developers expand into other areas (which they usually will if they
stay with the project), there is no administrative overhead to
granting them wider privileges.  Once the decision is made, the person
can just start committing in the new area right away.</para>

<para>Second, expansion can be done in a more fine-grained manner.
Generally, a committer in area X who wants to expand to area Y will
start posting patches against Y and asking for review.  If someone who
already has commit access to area Y sees such a patch and approves of
it, they can just tell the submitter to commit the change directly
(mentioning the reviewer/approver's name in the log message, of
course).  That way, the commit will come from the person who actually
wrote the change, which is preferable from both an information
management standpoint and from a crediting standpoint.</para>

<para>Last, and perhaps most important, using the honor system
encourages an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect.  Giving someone
commit access to a subdomain is a statement about their technical
preparedness&mdash;it says: "We see you have expertise to make commits
in a certain domain, so go for it."  But imposing strict authorization
controls says: "Not only are we asserting a limit on your expertise,
we're also a bit suspicious about
your <emphasis>intentions</emphasis>."  That's not the sort of
statement you want to make if you can avoid it.  Bringing someone into
the project as a committer is an opportunity to initiate them into a
circle of mutual trust.  A good way to do that is to give them more
power than they're supposed to use, then inform them that it's up to
them to stay within the stated limits.</para>

<para>The Subversion project has operated on the honor system way for
more than four years, with 33 full and 43 partial committers as of
this writing.  The only distinction the system actually enforces is
between committers and non-committers; further subdivisions are
maintained solely by humans.  Yet we've never had a problem with
someone deliberately committing outside their domain.  Once or twice
there's been an innocent misunderstanding about the extent of
someone's commit privileges, but it's always been resolved quickly and
amiably.</para>

<para>Obviously, in situations where self-policing is impractical, you
must rely on hard authorization controls.  But such situations are
rare.  Even when there are millions of lines of code and hundreds or
thousands of developers, a commit to any given code module should
still be reviewed by those who work on that module, and they can
recognize if someone committed there who wasn't supposed to.  If
regular commit review <emphasis>isn't</emphasis> happening, then the
project has bigger problems to deal with than the authorization system
anyway.</para>

<para>In summary, don't spend too much time fiddling with the version
control authorization system, unless you have a specific reason to.  It
usually won't bring much tangible benefit, and there are advantages to
relying on human controls instead.</para>

<para>None of this should be taken to mean that the restrictions
themselves are unimportant, of course.  It would be bad for a project
to encourage people to commit in areas where they're not qualified.
Furthermore, in many projects, full (unrestricted) commit access has a
special status: it implies voting rights on project-wide questions.
This political aspect of commit access is discussed more in <xref

<title>Bug Tracker</title>

<para>Bug tracking is a broad topic; various aspects of it are
discussed throughout this book.  Here I'll try to concentrate mainly
on setup and technical considerations, but to get to those, we have to
start with a policy question: exactly what kind of information should
be kept in a bug tracker?</para>

<para>The term <firstterm>bug tracker</firstterm> is misleading.  Bug
tracking systems are also frequently used to track new feature
requests, one-time tasks, unsolicited patches&mdash;really anything
that has distinct beginning and end states, with optional transition
states in between, and that accrues information over its lifetime.
For this reason, bug trackers are also called <firstterm>issue
trackers</firstterm>, <firstterm>defect trackers</firstterm>,
<firstterm>artifact trackers</firstterm>, <firstterm>request
trackers</firstterm>, <firstterm>trouble ticket systems</firstterm>,
etc.  See <xref linkend="bug-trackers"/> for a list of software.
</para>

<para>In this book, I'll continue to use "bug tracker" for the
software that does the tracking, because that's what most people call
it, but will use <firstterm>issue</firstterm> to refer to a single
item in the bug tracker's database.  This allows us to distinguish
between the behavior or misbehavior that the user encountered (that is,
the bug itself), and the tracker's <emphasis>record</emphasis> of the
bug's discovery, diagnosis, and eventual resolution.  Keep in mind
that although most issues are about actual bugs, issues can be used to
track other kinds of tasks too.</para>

<para>The classic issue life cycle looks like this:

<orderedlist>
  <listitem><para>Someone files the issue.  They provide a summary, an
            initial description (including a reproduction recipe, if
            applicable; see
            <xref
            linkend="users-to-volunteers"/><phrase
            output="printed"> in
            <xref linkend="managing-volunteers"/></phrase> for
            how to encourage good bug reports), and whatever other
            information the tracker asks for.  The person who files
            the issue may be totally unknown to the project&mdash;bug
            reports and feature requests are as likely to come from
            the user community as from the developers.</para>

            <para>Once filed, the issue is in what's called an
            <firstterm>open</firstterm> state.  Because no action has
            been taken yet, some trackers also label it as
            <firstterm>unverified</firstterm> and/or
            <firstterm>unstarted</firstterm>.  It is not assigned to
            anyone; or, in some systems, it is assigned to a fake
            user to represent the lack of real assignation.  At this
            point, it is in a holding area: the issue has been
            recorded, but not yet integrated into the project's
            consciousness.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>Others read the issue, add comments to it, and
            perhaps ask the original filer for clarification on some
            points.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>The bug gets <firstterm>reproduced</firstterm>.
            This may be the most important moment in its
            life cycle.  Although the bug is not actually fixed yet,
            the fact that someone besides the original filer was able
            to make it happen proves that it is genuine, and, no less
            importantly, confirms to the original filer that they've
            contributed to the project by reporting a real bug.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>The bug gets <firstterm>diagnosed</firstterm>: its
            cause is identified, and if possible, the effort required
            to fix it is estimated.  Make sure these things get
            recorded in the issue; if the person who diagnosed the
            bug suddenly has to step away from the project for a
            while (as can often happen with volunteer developers),
            someone else should be able to pick up where she left
            off.</para>

            <para>In this stage, or sometimes the previous one, a
            developer may "take ownership" of the issue and
            <firstterm>assign</firstterm> it to herself (<xref
            linkend="delegation-assignment"/><phrase
            output="printed"> in
            <xref linkend="managing-volunteers"/></phrase>
            examines the assignment process in more detail).  The issue's
            <firstterm>priority</firstterm> may also be set at this
            stage.  For example, if it is so severe that it should
            delay the next release, that fact needs to be identified
            early, and the tracker should have some way of noting
            it.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>The issue gets scheduled for resolution.
            Scheduling doesn't necessarily mean naming a date by which
            it will be fixed.  Sometimes it just means deciding which
            future release (not necessarily the next one) the bug
            should be fixed by, or deciding that it need not block any
            particular release.  Scheduling may also be dispensed
            with, if the bug is quick to fix.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>The bug gets fixed (or the task completed, or
            the patch applied, or whatever).  The change or set of
            changes that fixed it should be recorded in a comment in
            the issue, after which the issue is
            <firstterm>closed</firstterm> and/or marked as
            <firstterm>resolved</firstterm>.</para>
  </listitem>
</orderedlist>

</para>

<para>There are some common variations on this life cycle.  Sometimes
an issue is closed very soon after being filed, because it turns out
not to be a bug at all, but rather a misunderstanding on the part of
the user.  As a project acquires more users, more and more such
invalid issues will come in, and developers will close them with
increasingly short-tempered responses.  Try to guard against the
latter tendency.  It does no one any good, as the individual user in
each case is not responsible for all the previous invalid issues; the
statistical trend is visible only from the developers' point of view,
not the user's.  (In
<xref linkend="bug-filtering"/><phrase output="printed"> later
in this chapter,</phrase> we'll look at
techniques for reducing the number of invalid issues.)  Also, if
different users are experiencing the same misunderstanding over and
over, it might mean that that aspect of the software needs to be
redesigned.  This sort of pattern is easiest to notice when there is
an issue manager monitoring the bug database; see
<xref linkend="issue-manager"/><phrase output="printed"> in
<xref linkend="managing-volunteers"/></phrase>.</para>

<para>Another common life cycle variation is for the issue to be closed
as a <firstterm>duplicate</firstterm> soon after Step 1.  A duplicate
is when someone files an issue that's already known to the project.
Duplicates are not confined to open issues: it's possible for a bug to
come back after having been fixed (this is known as a
<firstterm>regression</firstterm>), in which case the preferred course
is usually to reopen the original issue and close any new reports as
duplicates of the original one.  The bug tracking system should keep
track of this relationship bidirectionally, so that reproduction
information in the duplicates is available to the original issue, and
vice versa.</para>

<para>A third variation is for the developers to close the issue,
thinking they have fixed it, only to have the original reporter reject
the fix and reopen it.  This is usually because the developers simply
don't have access to the environment necessary to reproduce the bug,
or because they didn't test the fix using the exact same reproduction
recipe as the reporter.</para>

<para>Aside from these variations, there may be other small details of
the life cycle that vary depending on the tracking software.  But the
basic shape is the same, and while the life cycle itself is not
specific to open source software, it has implications for how open
source projects use their bug trackers.</para>

<para>As Step 1 implies, the tracker is as much a public face of the
project as the mailing lists or web pages.  Anyone may file an issue,
anyone may look at an issue, and anyone may browse the list of currently
open issues.  It follows that you never know how many people are
waiting to see progress on a given issue.  While the size and skill of
the development community constrains the rate at which issues can be
resolved, the project should at least try to acknowledge each issue the
moment it appears.  Even if the issue lingers for a while, a response
encourages the reporter to stay involved, because she feels that a
human has registered what she has done (remember that filing an
issue usually involves more effort than, say, posting an email).
Furthermore, once an issue is seen by a developer, it enters the
project's consciousness, in the sense that that developer can be on
the lookout for other instances of the issue, can talk about it with
other developers, etc.</para>

<para>The need for timely reactions implies two things:

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>The tracker must be connected to a mailing list, such that
    every change to an issue, including its initial filing, causes a
    mail to go out describing what happened.  This mailing list
    is usually different from the regular development list, since not
    all developers may want to receive automated bug mails, but (just
    as with commit mails) the Reply-to header should be set to the
    development mailing list.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>The form for filing issues should capture the reporter's
    email address, so she can be contacted for more information.
    (However, it should not <emphasis>require</emphasis> the
    reporter's email address, as some people prefer to report issues
    anonymously.  See
    <xref linkend="anonymity"/><phrase output="printed"> later
    in this chapter</phrase> for more on the importance of
    anonymity.)</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</para>

<sect2 id="bug-tracker-mailing-list-interaction">
<title>Interaction with Mailing Lists</title>

<para>Make sure the bug tracker doesn't turn into a discussion forum.
Although it is important to maintain a human presence in the bug
tracker, it is not fundamentally suited to real-time discussion.
Think of it rather as an archiver, a way to organize facts and
references to other discussions, primarily those that take place on
mailing lists.</para>

<para>There are two reasons to make this distinction.  First, the bug
tracker is more cumbersome to use than the mailing lists (or than
real-time chat forums, for that matter).  This is not because bug
trackers have bad user interface design, it's just that their
interfaces were designed for capturing and presenting discrete states,
not free-flowing discussions.  Second, not everyone who should be
involved in discussing a given issue is necessarily watching the bug
tracker.  Part of good issue management (see
<xref linkend="share-management"/><phrase output="printed"> in
<xref linkend="managing-volunteers"/></phrase>) is to make sure
each issue is brought to the right peoples' attention, rather than
requiring every developer to monitor all issues.  In
<xref linkend="bug-tracker-usage"/><phrase output="printed"> in <xref linkend="communications"/>,</phrase> we'll look at ways to make
sure people don't accidentally siphon discussions out of appropriate
forums and into the bug tracker.</para>

<para>Some bug trackers can monitor mailing lists and automatically
log all emails that are about a known issue.  Typically they do this
by recognizing the issue's identifying number in the subject line of
the mail, as part of a special string; developers learn to include
these strings in their mails to attract the tracker's notice.  The bug
tracker may either save the entire email, or (even better) just record
a link to the mail in the regular mailing list archive.  Either way,
this is a very useful feature; if your tracker has it, make sure
both to turn it on and to remind people to take advantage of
it.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="bug-filtering">
<title>Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker</title>

<para>Most issue databases eventually suffer from the same problem: a
crushing load of duplicate or invalid issues filed by well-meaning but
inexperienced or ill-informed users.  The first step in combatting
this trend is usually to put a prominent notice on the front page of
the bug tracker, explaining how to tell if a bug is really a bug, how
to search to see if it's already been filed, and finally, how to
effectively report it if one still thinks it's a new bug.</para>

<para>This will reduce the noise level for a while, but as the number
of users increases, the problem will eventually come back.  No
individual user can be blamed for it.  Each one is just trying to
contribute to the project's well-being, and even if their first bug
report isn't helpful, you still want to encourage them to stay
involved and file better issues in the future.  In the meantime,
though, the project needs to keep the issue database as free of junk
as possible.</para>

<para>The two things that will do the most to prevent this problem
are: making sure there are people watching the bug tracker who have
enough knowledge to close issues as invalid or duplicates the moment
they come in, and requiring (or strongly encouraging) users to confirm
their bugs with other people before filing them in the tracker.</para>

<para>The first technique seems to be used universally.  Even projects
with huge issue databases (say, the Debian bug tracker at
<ulink url="http://bugs.debian.org/"/>, which contained 315,929 issues
as of this writing) still arrange things so that
<emphasis>someone</emphasis> sees each issue that comes in.  It may be
a different person depending on the category of the issue.  For
example, the Debian project is a collection of software packages, so
Debian automatically routes each issue to the appropriate package
maintainers.  Of course, users can sometimes misidentify an issue's
category, with the result that the issue is sent to the wrong person
initially, who may then have to reroute it.  However, the important
thing is that the burden is still shared&mdash;whether the user
guesses right or wrong when filing, issue watching is still
distributed more or less evenly among the developers, so each issue is
able to receive a timely response.</para>

<para>The second technique is less widespread, probably because it's
harder to automate.  The essential idea is that every new issue gets
"buddied" into the database.  When a user thinks he's found a problem,
he is asked to describe it on one of the mailing lists, or in an IRC
channel, and get confirmation from someone that it is indeed a bug.
Bringing in that second pair of eyes early can prevent a lot of
spurious reports.  Sometimes the second party is able to identify that
the behavior is not a bug, or is fixed in recent releases.  Or she may
be familiar with the symptoms from a previous issue, and can prevent a
duplicate filing by pointing the user to the older issue.  Often it's
enough just to ask the user "Did you search the bug tracker to see if
it's already been reported?"  Many people simply don't think of that,
yet are happy to do the search once they know someone's
<emphasis>expecting</emphasis> them to.</para>

<para>The buddy system can really keep the issue database clean, but
it has some disadvantages too.  Many people will file solo anyway,
either through not seeing, or through disregarding, the instructions
to find a buddy for new issues.  Thus it is still necessary for
volunteers to watch the issue database.  Furthermore, because most new
reporters don't understand how difficult the task of maintaining the
issue database is, it's not fair to chide them too harshly for
ignoring the guidelines.  Thus the volunteers must be vigilant, and
yet exercise restraint in how they bounce unbuddied issues back to
their reporters.  The goal is to train each reporter to use the
buddying system in the future, so that there is an ever-growing pool
of people who understand the issue-filtering system.  On seeing an
unbuddied issue, the ideal steps are:</para>

<orderedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>Immediately respond to the issue, politely thanking the user
          for filing, but pointing them to the buddying guidelines
          (which should, of course, be prominently posted on the web
          site).</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>If the issue is clearly valid and not a duplicate, approve it
          anyway, and start it down the normal life cycle.  After all,
          the reporter's now been informed about buddying, so there's
          no point wasting the work done so far by closing a valid
          issue.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>Otherwise, if the issue is not clearly valid, close it, but
          ask the reporter to reopen it if they get confirmation from
          a buddy.   When they do, they should put a reference to the
          confirmation thread (e.g., a URL into the mailing list
          archives).</para>
  </listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Remember that although this system will improve the signal/noise
ratio in the issue database over time, it will never completely stop
the misfilings.  The only way to prevent misfilings entirely is to
close off the bug tracker to everyone but developers&mdash;a cure that
is almost always worse than the disease.  It's better to accept that
cleaning out invalid issues will always be part of the project's
routine maintenance, and to try to get as many people as possible to
help.</para>

<sect1 id="irc">
<title>IRC / Real-Time Chat Systems</title>

<para>Many projects offer real-time chat rooms using <firstterm>Internet
Relay Chat</firstterm> (<firstterm>IRC</firstterm>), forums where users
and developers can ask each other questions and get instant responses.
While you <emphasis>can</emphasis> run an IRC server from your own
web site, it is generally not worth the hassle.  Instead, do what
everyone else does: run your IRC channels at Freenode
(<ulink url="http://freenode.net/"/>).  Freenode gives you the control
you need to administer your project's IRC
channels,<footnote><para>There is no requirement or expectation that
you donate to Freenode, but if you or your project can afford it,
please consider a contribution.  They are a tax-exempt charity in the
U.S., and they perform a valuable service.</para></footnote> while
sparing you the not-insignificant trouble of maintaining an IRC server
yourself.</para>

<para>The first thing to do is choose a channel name.  The most
obvious choice is the name of your project&mdash;if that's available
at Freenode, then use it.  If not, try to choose something as close to
your project's name, and as easy to remember, as possible.  Advertise
the channel's availabity from your project's web site, so a visitor
with a quick question will see it right away.  For example, this
appears in a prominently placed box at the top of Subversion's home
page:</para>

  <blockquote>
    <para><emphasis>If you're using Subversion, we recommend that you
    join the</emphasis> <literal>users@subversion.tigris.org</literal>
    <emphasis>mailing list, and read the <ulink
    url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Subversion Book</ulink> and
    <ulink
    url="http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html">FAQ</ulink>.
    You can also ask questions on IRC at</emphasis>
    <literal>irc.freenode.net</literal>
    <emphasis>channel</emphasis>&nbsp;<literal>#svn</literal>.</para>
  </blockquote>

<para>Some projects have multiple channels, one per subtopic.  For
example, one channel for installation problems, another for usage
questions, another for development chat, etc. (<xref
linkend="growth"/><phrase output="printed"> in
<xref linkend="communications"/></phrase> discusses and how to
divide into multiple channels).  When your project is young, there
should only be one channel, with everyone talking together.  Later, as
the user-to-developer ratio increases, separate channels may become
necessary.</para>

<para>How will people know all the available channels, let alone which
channel to talk in?  And when they talk, how will they know what the
local conventions are?</para>

<para>The answer is to tell them by setting the <firstterm>channel
topic</firstterm>.<footnote><para>To set a channel topic, use the
<literal>/topic</literal> command.  All commands in IRC start with
"<literal>/</literal>".  See <ulink url="http://www.irchelp.org/"/> if
you're not familiar with IRC usage and administration; in particular,
<ulink url="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/irctutorial.html"/> is an
excellent tutorial.</para></footnote>  The channel topic is a brief
message each user sees when they first enter the channel.  It gives
quick guidance to newcomers, and pointers to further information.  For
example:</para>

<screen>
You are now talking on #svn

Topic for #svn is Forum for Subversion user questions, see also
http://subversion.tigris.org/. || Development discussion happens in
#svn-dev. || Please don't paste long transcripts here, instead use
a pastebin site like http://pastebin.ca/. || NEWS: Subversion 1.1.0
is released, see http://svn110.notlong.com/ for details.
</screen>

<para>That's terse, but it tells newcomers what they need to know.  It
says exactly what the channel is for, gives the project home page (in
case someone wanders into the channel without having first been to the
project web site), mentions a related channel, and gives some guidance
about pasting.</para>

<sidebar id="paste-sites">
<title>Paste Sites</title>

<para>An IRC channel is a shared space: everyone can see what everyone
else is saying.  Normally, this is a good thing, as it allows people
to jump into a conversation when they think they have something to
contribute, and allows spectators to learn by watching.  But it
becomes problematic when someone has to provide a large quantity of
information at once, such as a debugging session transcript, because
pasting too many lines of output into the channel will disrupt other
conversations.</para>

<para>The solution is to use one of the
<firstterm>pastebin</firstterm> or <firstterm>pastebot</firstterm>
sites.  When requesting a large amount of data from someone, ask them
not to paste it into the channel, but instead to go to (for example)
<ulink url="http://pastebin.ca/"/>, paste their data into the form
there, and tell the resulting new URL to the IRC channel.  Anyone can
then visit the URL and view the data.</para>

<para>There are a number of free paste sites available now, too many
for a comprehensive list, but here are some of the ones I've seen used:
<ulink url="http://www.nomorepasting.com/"/>,
<ulink url="http://pastebin.ca/"/>,
<ulink url="http://nopaste.php.cd/"/>
<ulink url="http://rafb.net/paste/"/>
<ulink url="http://sourcepost.sytes.net/"/>,

and

</sidebar>

<sect2 id="bots">
<title>Bots</title>

<para>Many technically-oriented IRC channels have a non-human member,
a so-called <firstterm>bot</firstterm>, that is capable of storing and
regurgitating information in response to specific commands.
Typically, the bot is addressed just like any other member of the
channel, that is, the commands are delivered by "speaking to" the bot.
For example:</para>

<screen>
&lt;kfogel&gt; ayita: learn diff-cmd = http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
&lt;ayita&gt;  Thanks!
</screen>

<para>That told the bot (who is logged into the channel as ayita) to
remember a certain URL as the answer to the query "diff-cmd".  Now we
can address ayita, asking the bot to tell another user about
diff-cmd:</para>

<screen>
&lt;kfogel&gt; ayita: tell jrandom about diff-cmd
&lt;ayita&gt;  jrandom: http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
</screen>

<para>The same thing can be accomplished via a convenient shorthand:</para>

<screen>
&lt;kfogel&gt; !a jrandom diff-cmd
&lt;ayita&gt;  jrandom: http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
</screen>

<para>The exact command set and behaviors differ from bot to bot.  The
above example is with <literal>ayita</literal>
(<ulink url="http://hix.nu/svn-public/alexis/trunk/"/>), of which
there is usually an instance running in <literal>#svn</literal> at
freenode.  Other bots include Dancer
(<ulink url="http://dancer.sourceforge.net/"/>) and Supybot
(<ulink url="http://supybot.com/"/>).  Note that no special server
privileges are required to run a bot.  A bot is a client program;
anyone can set one up and direct it to listen to a particular
server/channel.</para>

<para>If your channel tends to get the same questions over and over,
I highly recommend setting up a bot.  Only a small percentage of
channel users will acquire the expertise needed to manipulate the bot,
but those users will answer a disproportionately high percentage of
questions, because the bot enables them to respond so much more
efficiently.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="irc-archiving">
<title>Archiving IRC</title>

<para>Although it is possible to archive everything that happens in an
IRC channel, it's not necessarily expected.  IRC conversations may be
nominally public, but many people think of them as informal,
semi-private conversations.  Users may be careless with grammar, and
often express opinions (for example, about other software or other
programmers) that they wouldn't want preserved forever in an online
archive.</para>

<para>Of course, there will sometimes be <emphasis>excerpts</emphasis>
that should be preserved, and that's fine.  Most IRC clients can log a
conversation to a file at the user's request, or failing that, one can
always just cut and paste the conversation from IRC into a more
permanent forum (most often the bug tracker).  But indiscriminate
logging may make some users uneasy.  If you do archive everything,
make sure you state so clearly in the channel topic, and give a URL to
the archive.</para>

<sect1 id="rss">
<title>RSS Feeds</title>

<para><firstterm>RSS</firstterm> (Really Simple Syndication) is a
mechanism for distributing meta-data-rich news summaries to
"subscribers", that is, people who have indicated an interest in
receiving those summaries.  A given RSS source is usually called
a <firstterm>feed</firstterm>, and the user's subscription interface
is called a <firstterm>feed reader</firstterm> or <firstterm>feed
aggregator</firstterm>.  <ulink url="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSS
Bandit</ulink> and the eponymous
<ulink url="http://www.feedreader.com/">Feedreader</ulink> are two
open source RSS readers, for example.</para>

<para>There is not space here for a detailed technical explanation of
RSS<footnote><para>See
<ulink url="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html"/>
for that.</para></footnote>, but you should be aware of two main
things.  First, the feed reading software is chosen by the subscriber
and is <emphasis>the same</emphasis> for all the feeds that subscriber
monitors&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;in fact, this is the major selling point of
RSS: that the subscriber chooses one interface to use for all their
feeds, so each feed can concentrate just on delivering content.
Second, RSS is now ubiquitous, so much so that most people who use it
don't even know they're using it.  To the world at large, RSS looks
like a little button on a web page, with a label saying "Subscribe to
this site" or "News feed".  You click on the button, and from then on,
your feed reader (which may well be an applet embedded in your home
page) automatically updates whenever there's news from the
site.</para>

<para>This means that your open source project should probably offer
an RSS feed (note that many of the canned hosting
sites&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;see
<xref linkend="canned-hosting"/>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;offer it right out
of the box).  Be careful not to post so many news items each day that
subscribers can't separate the wheat from the chaff.  If there are too
many news events, people will just ignore the feed, or even
unsubscribe in exasperation.  Ideally, a project would offer separate
feeds, one for big announcements, another following (say) events in
the issue tracker, another for each mailing list, etc.  In practice,
this is hard to do well: it can result in interface confusion both for
visitors to the project's web site and for the administrators.  But at
a minimum, the project should offer one RSS feed on the front page,
for sending out major announcements such as releases and security
alerts.<footnote><para>Credit where credit is due: this section wasn't

<title>Wikis</title>

<para>A <firstterm>wiki</firstterm> is a web site that allows any
visitor to edit or extend its content; the term "wiki" (from a
Hawaiian word meaning "quick" or "super-fast") is also used to refer
to the software that enables such editing.  Wikis were invented in
1995, but their popularity has really started to take off since 2000
or 2001, boosted partly by the success of Wikipedia (<ulink
url="http://www.wikipedia.org/"/>), a wiki-based free-content
encyclopedia.  Think of a wiki as falling somewhere between IRC and
web pages: wikis don't happen in realtime, so people get a chance to
ponder and polish their contributions, but they are also very easy to
add to, involving less interface overhead than editing a regular web
page.</para>

<para>Wikis are not yet standard equipment for open source projects,
but they probably will be soon.  As they are relatively new
technology, and people are still experimenting with different ways of
using them, I will just offer a few words of caution here&mdash;at
this stage, it's easier to analyze misuses of wikis than to analyze
their successes.</para>

<para>If you decide to run a wiki, put a lot of effort into having a
clear page organization and pleasing visual layout, so that visitors
(i.e., potential editors) will instinctively know how to fit in their
contributions.  Equally important, post those standards on the wiki
itself, so people have somewhere to go for guidance.  Too often, wiki
administrators fall victim to the fantasy that because hordes of
visitors are individually adding high quality content to the site,
the sum of all these contributions must therefore also be of high
quality.  That's not how web sites work.  Each individual page or
paragraph may be good when considered by itself, but it will not be
good if embedded in a disorganized or confusing whole.  Too often,
wikis suffer from:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
     <para><emphasis role="bold">Lack of navigational principles.</emphasis>
     A well-organized web site makes visitors feel like they know
     where they are at any time.  For example, if the pages are
     well-designed, people can intuitively tell the difference
     between a "table of contents" region and a "content" region.
     Contributors to a wiki will respect such differences too, but
     only if the differences are present to begin with.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
     <para><emphasis role="bold">Duplication of information.</emphasis>
     Wikis frequently end up with different pages saying similar
     things, because the individual contributors did not notice the
     duplications.  This can be partly a consequence of the lack of
     navigational principles noted above, in that people may not find
     the duplicate content if it is not where they expect it to
     be.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
     <para><emphasis role="bold">Inconsistent target audience.</emphasis>
     To some degree this problem is inevitable when there are so many
     authors, but it can be lessened if there are written guidelines
     about how to create new content.  It also helps to aggressively
     edit new contributions at the beginning, as an example, so that
     the standards start to sink in.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The common solution to all these problems is the same: have
editorial standards, and demonstrate them not only by posting them,
but by editing pages to adhere to them.  In general, wikis will
amplify any failings in their original material, since contributors
imitate whatever patterns they see in front of them.  Don't just
set up the wiki and hope everything falls into place.  You must also
prime it with well-written content, so people have a template to
follow.</para>

<para>The shining example of a well-run wiki is Wikipedia, though this
may be partly 
because the content (encyclopedia entries) is naturally well-suited to
the wiki format.  But if you examine Wikipedia closely, you'll see
that its administrators laid a <emphasis>very</emphasis> thorough
foundation for cooperation.  There is extensive documentation on how
to write new entries, how to maintain an appropriate point of view,
what sorts of edits to make, what edits to avoid, a dispute resolution
process for contested edits (involving several stages, including
eventual arbitration), and so forth.  They also have authorization
controls, so that if a page is the target of repeated inappropriate
edits, they can lock it down until the problem is resolved.  In other
words, they didn't just throw some templates onto a web site and hope
for the best.  Wikipedia works because its founders thought carefully
about how to get thousands of strangers to tailor their writing to a
common vision.  While you may not need the same level of preparedness
to run a wiki for a free software project, the spirit is worth
emulating.</para>

<title>Web Site</title>

<para>There is not much to say about setting up the project web site
from a technical point of view: setting up a web server and writing
web pages are fairly simple tasks, and most of the important things to
say about layout and arrangement were covered in the previous chapter.
The web site's main function is to present a clear and welcoming
overview of the project, and to bind together the other tools (the
version control system, bug tracker, etc.).  If you don't have the
expertise to set up a web server yourself, it's usually not hard to
find someone who does and is willing to help out.  Nonetheless, to
save time and effort, people often prefer to use one of the canned
hosting sites.</para>

<sect2 id="canned-hosting">
<title>Canned Hosting</title>

<para>There are two main advantages to using a canned site.  The first
is server capacity and bandwidth: their servers are beefy boxes sitting
on really fat pipes.  No matter how successful your project gets,
you're not going to run out of disk space or swamp the network
connection.  The second advantage is simplicity.  They have already
chosen a bug tracker, a version control system, a mailing list manager,
an archiver, and everything else you need to run a site.  They've
configured the tools, and are taking care of backups for all the data
stored in the tools.  You don't need to make many decisions.  All you
have to do is fill in a form, press a button, and suddenly you've got
a project web site.</para>

<para>These are pretty significant benefits.  The disadvantage, of
course, is that you must accept <emphasis>their</emphasis> choices and
configurations, even if something different would be better for your
project.  Usually canned sites are adjustable within certain narrow
parameters, but you will never get the fine-grained control you would
have if you set up the site yourself and had full administrative
access to the server.</para>

<para>A perfect example of this is the handling of generated files.
Certain project web pages may be generated files&mdash;for example,
there are systems for keeping FAQ data in an easy-to-edit master
format, from which HTML, PDF, and other presentation formats can be
generated.  As explained in
<xref linkend="version-everything"/><phrase output="printed">
earlier in this chapter</phrase>,
you wouldn't want to version the generated formats, only the master
file.  But when your web site is hosted on someone else's server, it
may be impossible to set up a custom hook to regenerate the online
HTML version of the FAQ whenever the master file is changed.  The only
workaround is to version the generated formats too, so that they show
up on the web site.</para>

<para>There can be larger consequences as well.  You may not have as
much control over presentation as you would wish.  Some of the canned
hosting sites allow you to customize your web pages, but the site's
default layout usually ends up showing through in various awkward
ways.  For example, some projects that host themselves at SourceForge
have completely customized home pages, but still point developers to
their "SourceForge page" for more information.  The SourceForge page
is what would be the project's home page, had the project not used a
custom home page.  The SourceForge page has links to the bug tracker,
the CVS repository, downloads, etc.  Unfortunately, a SourceForge page
also contains a great deal of extraneous noise.  The top is a banner
ad, often an animated image.  The left side is a vertical arrangement
of links of little relevance to someone interested in the project.
The right side is often another advertisement.  Only the center of the
page is devoted to truly project-specific material, and even that is
arranged in a confusing way that often makes visitors unsure of what
to click on next.</para>

<para>Behind every individual aspect of SourceForge's design, there is
no doubt a good reason&mdash;good from SourceForge's point of view,
such as the advertisements.  But from an individual project's point of
view, the result can be a less-than-ideal web page.  I don't mean to
pick on SourceForge; similar concerns apply to many of the canned
hosting sites.  The point is that there's a tradeoff.  You get relief
from the technical burdens of running a project site, but only at the
price of accepting someone else's way of running it.</para>

<para>Only you can decide whether canned hosting is best for your
project.  If you choose a canned site, leave open the option of
switching to your own servers later, by using a custom domain name for
the project's "home address".  You can forward the URL to the canned
site, or have a fully customized home page at the public URL and hand
users off to the canned site for sophisticated functionality.  Just
make sure to arrange things such that if you later decide to use a
different hosting solution, the project's address doesn't need to
change.</para>

<sect3 id="canned-hosting-choosing">
<title>Choosing a canned hosting site</title>

<para>There are now (as of early 2011) an established Big Three of
free canned hosting sites.  All three offer free-of-charge hosting for
projects released under open source licenses.  They provide version
control, bug tracking, and wikis (some also offer other features, such
as binary downloads):</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
     <para><ulink url="http://github.com/"
           >GitHub</ulink>
     Version control is Git only&mdash;but if you're using
     Git anyway, this is probably the right place for your project.
     GitHub has become the center of the universe for Git projects,
     and has integrated all their services with Git.  GitHub also
     offers a full <ulink url="http://develop.github.com/"
     >API</ulink> for interacting programmatically with their service.
     It does not provide mailing lists; however, they are available so
     many other places that that shouldn't matter much.
     </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
     <para><ulink url="http://code.google.com/hosting/"
           >Google Code Hosting</ulink>
     Offers Subversion and Mercurial version control systems (no Git,
     at least not yet), wikis, a downloads area, and a rather nice bug
     tracker.  It also comes with APIs: the version control systems
     are naturally their own API; the issue tracker has 
     <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/IssueTrackerAPI"
     >its own API</ulink>; the wiki content is offered <ulink
     url="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiFAQ#How_do_I_edit_a_wiki_page_directly_through_subversion?"
     >directly in the version control system</ulink> and is thus
     editable by scripts; and the downloads area offers <ulink
     url="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/ScriptedUploads"
     >scripted uploads</ulink>, in other words, an API.
     Mailing lists are provided via <ulink
     url="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</ulink> (then
     again, the same statement could be made of any hosting site).
     </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
     <para><ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/"
           >SourceForge</ulink>
     This is the oldest, and by some measures still the largest, of
     the free hosting sites.  It provides all the features the others
     do, and its interface is quite usable; however, some people find
     the advertising blocks on project pages to be distracting.  It
     appears to be the only one of the Big Three that offers all the
     major version control systems (Git, Subversion, Mercurial, and
     CVS) right now.  SourceForge also provides its own mailing lists,
     though you could of course use some other mailing list service.
     </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>A few organizations, for example the <ulink
url="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</ulink>, also
offer free hosting to open source projects that fit well with their
missions and their community of existing projects.</para>

<para>If you're in doubt about where to host, I strongly recommend
just going with one of the big three.  If you want even more guidance:
use GitHub if your project uses Git for version control, otherwise use
Google Code Hosting.  SourceForge is also perfectly acceptable, but at
this point it has no significant advantage over the others, and the
advertising can be annoying.</para>

<para>Many people have observed that free project hosting sites
themselves often do not make all the software that runs the site
avialble under a free software license (some that do are <ulink
url="http://launchpad.net" >Launchpad</ulink>, <ulink
url="http://gitorious.org/" >Gitorious</ulink> and <ulink
url="http://savannah.gnu.org/" >GNU Savannah</ulink>).  My feeling is
that while it would be ideal to have access to all the code that runs
the site, the crucial thing is to have a way export your data, and to
be able to interact with your data in an automated way.  Such a site
can never truly lock you in, and will even be extensible to a degree,
through the programmatic interface.  While there is some value in
having all the code that runs a hosting site available under open
source terms, in practice, the demands of actually deploying that code
in a production environment are prohibitive for most users.  These
sites need multiple servers, customized networks, and full-time staffs
to keep them running; merely having the code would not be sufficient
to duplicate or "fork" the service anyway.  The main thing is just to
make sure your data isn't trapped.</para>

<para>Wikipedia has a thorough <ulink
url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities"
>comparison of hosting facilities</ulink>; it's the first place to
look for up-to-date, comprehensive information on open source project
hosting options.  Haggen So also did a thorough evaluation of various
canned hosting sites, as part of the research for his Ph.D. thesis,
<citetitle>Construction of an Evaluation Model for Free/Open Source
Project Hosting (FOSPHost) sites</citetitle>.  Although it was done in
2005, he appears to have updated it as recently as 2007, and his
criteria are likely to remain valid for a long time.  His results are
at <ulink url="http://www.ibiblio.org/fosphost/"/>, and see especially
the very readable comparison chart at <ulink
url="http://www.ibiblio.org/fosphost/exhost.htm"/>.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="anonymity">
<title>Anonymity and involvement</title>

<para>A problem that is not strictly limited to the canned sites, but
is most often found there, is the abuse of user login functionality.
The functionality itself is simple enough: the site allows each
visitor to register herself with a username and password.  From
then on it keeps a profile for that user, and project administrators
can assign the user certain permissions, for example, the right to
commit to the repository.</para>

<para>This can be extremely useful, and in fact it's one of the prime
advantages of canned hosting.  The problem is that sometimes user
login ends up being required for tasks that ought to be permitted to
unregistered visitors, specifically the ability to file issues in the
bug tracker, and to comment on existing issues.  By requiring a
logged-in username for such actions, the project raises the
involvement bar for what should be quick, convenient tasks.  Of
course, one wants to be able to contact someone who's entered data
into the issue tracker, but having a field where she can enter her
email address (if she wants to) is sufficient.  If a new user spots a
bug and wants to report it, she'll only be annoyed at having to fill
out an account creation form before she can enter the bug into the
tracker.  She may simply decide not to file the bug at all.</para>

<para>The advantages of user management generally outweigh the
disadvantages.  But if you can choose which actions can be done
anonymously, make sure not only that <emphasis>all</emphasis>
read-only actions are permitted to non-logged-in visitors, but also
some data entry actions, especially in the bug tracker and, if you
have them, wiki pages.</para>
