This is mostly todo items for the 2nd edition, plus some random other stuff.
Many items here may not make sense to people other than the book's author.

This file is probably not complete, either.  If something you expected
to see here is missing, the omission is probably not intentional. 

* Arches project as example of why attention bandwidth / resources
   can mean heads-down initial development makes sense sometimes.
   See Koen van Daele's mail about this ("Re: Arches") Aug/Sep 2012.
* On POSS site, link to CivComs blog posts, CivComs Wiki, etc.
* Changes for 2nd edition
** OpenHatch / peers@ list
** Comb Jono Bacon's book again for topic coverage.
** Dreamwidth
** Ask around!
** jorendorff's question about read access to security bugs,
    apparently an internal debate at Mozilla citing
    http://blog.gerv.net/2011/12/a-level-playing-field/ which cites POSS
    story about Mike Pilato and commit access.  See IRC transcript
    in #red-bean of 2012-08-15.
** GitHub, bug trackers update
** Look on foundations list for some recent discussions, e.g.,
   "advice on branding and open source communities"
** OSS and gov't
** See Mel Chua's mails

   First, I was working on the IRC section, there was a list of
   open source pastebin sites (gray box):
    http://producingoss.com/en/irc.html
   What do you think on Gist https://gist.github.com/ as run by GitHub?
   Is it popular? Should it be in the list?
   
   Second, I translated RSS section into German. There were some readers
   mentioned. I think modern mail clients or browsers can be used to.
   I don't know if it's really popular, but I read RSS only within
   Thunderbird, my mail client. Should this be made explicit?

   Hi Karl,
   
   here you predict it, now it's become true ;-)
   
   > (no Git, at least not yet)
   
   http://producingoss.com/en/web-site.html#canned-hosting-choosing
   ...but I think this should be updated.
   
*** note that web-based presentation of diffs on Google Code is
   thought ugly by some; compare to SF or GitHub.  GitHub has
   commenting on commits (line-based if nessesary!), though, and it's
   fast too.
* producingoss mailer.py upgrade to get 'commit_url' config param?
  Anything to do here?
* Explanation of POSS web site to ORM:
   The online version has some properties that I'd like to maintain -- the
   most important is probably the human-readable anchor names, for example:
   
     http://producingoss.com/en/forks.html#forks-handling
   
   It's not just that they're human-readable, it's that they stay stable no
   matter how content moves around.  I could move the material about forks
   to a completely different chapter, but the URL would stay the same (and
   when someone went to it directly online, they would automatically be in
   the right chapter when they got there, whatever chapter it is).
   
   Out on the Net, people refer to particular parts of the book using those
   section & anchor names.  So I can't afford to break those.
