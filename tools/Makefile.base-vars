# This file -  Makefile.base-vars - together with the file Makefile.base-rules,
# make up a reusable buildsystem for DocBook XML books.
# The split into two files is required because of the nature of Make variables:
# In the case of variables used in commands, expansion occurs when the commands
# are executed, so values can be overridden by defining a new value after the
# rule definition - BUT in the case of variables used to specify targets and
# sources, expansion occurs when Make parses the rule.  Therefore, any override
# must take place BEFORE the rule definition.  Since this Makefile fragment
# wishes to both provide defaults and allow overriding of target and source
# file names, it is necessary to place the default variable definitions in
# one file, and the rules in another, so that overrides may be specified
# after the defaults, but before the rules - like this:
#
#   include ../tools/Makefile.base-vars
#   NAME = my-book
#   DIR = my-book-dir
#   include ../tools/Makefile.base-rules
#
# Note that this is a Makefile fragment intended for inclusion.  As a result,
# all relative paths contained within are relative to including Makefile's
# directory, not to this fragment's directory.  The TOOLS_DIR and DIR variables
# should be overridden if necessary to ensure proper paths are used.

# Paths which you may wish to customize:
